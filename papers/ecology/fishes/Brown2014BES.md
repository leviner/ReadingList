## Title:

## Keywords:

## Significance:
Background level of predation risk (pre-exposure) is a stronger driver of neophobic response than concentration of cue.

## Notes:
Reliability of public (shared) knowledge of predation threat can limit the preys ability to respond effectively.  Prey has to rely on learned predator recognition to respond appropriately, but there is in fact a risk to learning those cues in the first place (i.e., to know predator cues, you have to be exposed to predators).  "As the certainty of risk associated with specific forms of public information increases, we might predict that the ability of prey to balance behavioral trade-offs should also increase"

They test two mechanisms that may drive the intensity of response to novel cues:
- The concentration of the novel cue may be enough to modulate the response, just based on perception (expose them to high and low risk, then test their response to different levels of cues)
- The intensity of the response should match the background level of risk experienced by prey rather than cue detected (pre condition them to high, medium, low risk, then expose them all to the same level of cue)

They recorded time spent moving and foraging after the addition of a predator cur to the tanks to quantify impacts.

Experiment 1: Fish will show a concentration dependent response to predator cues, and pre-condition to high and low concentrations will change their response.
- Significant interaction between pre-exposure conditions and concentrations.
- For fish with no previous exposure, there was no difference among the predator treatments
- For fish with previous exposure, there was a significant difference between the two high and two low predator treatments

Experiment 2: precondition fish to a wider range of conditions, and then provide a cue or control.
- significant interaction between risk level and stimulus
- significant effect of pre-exposure on response to cues, in line with the concentration of cue.

With no previous exposure, varying the level of cue concentration has no graded response (experiment 1), rather a 'yes' or 'no' at certain thresholds.  However when preexposed to a range of risk, their response to cues varies as a function of that preexposure (experiment 2).

"The ability to make threat- sensitive decisions based on available chemosensory cues is likely based on the reliability of risk assessment information (i.e. value) associated with specific cues."  Therefore there may be graded responses to higher level cues (med, med-high, high) but not to lower ones (med-low, low)
