## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Use of particle simulation modeling and larval surveys to investigate the role of mesoscale eddies on the transport/retention of capelin larvae along he Norwegian coast.

## Notes:
Hydrography can have significant impacts on abundance and recruitment, in particular retention of larvae and eggs. Advection, in combination with food and predator abundance leads to successful recruitment. Capelin spawn in shallow coastal, high velocity environments, where they can be trapped in the Norwegian Coastal Current. Mesoscale eddies are important to this retention and transport.

Surveys were completed within the NCC using towed physical data instrumentation and mocness sampling to collect capelin larvae.

Particle tracking modeling was used to simulate passive larval distribution and asses the potential downstream advection and retention. Larvae were released over an assumed hatching period of 1 month at two fixed depths.
- The simulation showed there was a retention field during certain windows of the field campaign.
- 80% of particles were advected past the retention field downstream.
- Overall, this region is highly chaotic with rapid changes in currents and high velocities.

The field data was used to inform the model simulations, in particular to confirm the location of the hatching grounds used to simulate dispersal. The eddies found in the model were not concurrent with observations in the field, likely due to model simplification due to resolution.

The proportion of larvae retained (20%) is based on entirely passive behavior, though how well this represents the biology of the organisms in unknown. They do have the ability to swim at low speeds, though a) this self-propulsion will be in addition to the calculated drift, and b) it is unknown how well they can perform directed swimming movement (i.e., maintain behavior against the current). Thus they assume for the purpose of this work they are passive.

The small eddy dynamics observed are less predictable than the circulation pattern, but may be more important for retaining part of the larvae and moving animals offshore. This dispersal can impact any density-dependent factors in recruitment success, or just as likely transport larvae away from opportunistic prey within shallow coastal areas (or just as likely away from predators).
