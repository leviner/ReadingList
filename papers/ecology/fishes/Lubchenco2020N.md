## Significance:
Priorities and suggestions of the Ocean Panel for global policy action  for ocean energy, sustainability, and accounting.

## Notes:
Manage seafood production sustainably
- We need to increase protein production in order to support global population. Agriculture expansion, particularly through passive (i.e., filter) feeders are key as most bony fish require fish meal production for food. Improved management of wild stocks, increasing depleted stocks, and improve international fisheries management is needed.

Mitigate climate change
- Ocean-based reduction efforts could account for 1/5 of emissions reductions necessary to meet the Paris agreement. Ocean energy should be heavily invested in, with studies required to investigate environmental impacts of infrastructure. Reduction in carbon emissions from the shipping industry and development of zero-emission fuels will be necessary. Regulations are needed to further minimize the transfer of invasive species, reduce engine noise, and minimize heavy fuel oil usage. Reduced destruction and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems (e.g., mangroves) is needed to sequest carbon.

Reduce loss of biodiversity
- Vastly increase the area of the ocean classified as MPAs to limit destructive fishing behaviors.

Increase economic investment in ocean sectors
- Create blue recovery initiatives in the following areas:
  1. Coastal ecosystem restoration, which lead to enhancement of tourism activities
  2. Infrastructure for sewage and wastewater treatment for improvement of health and water quality
  3. Community-led aquaculture such as shellfish beds
  4. Incentivize zero-emission marine transport and travel
  5. Investing in ocean-based energy generation

Manage the ocean holistically
- Ecosystem-based management and integrated management that doesn't result in spatially patchy or sector-focused regulations is needed.
