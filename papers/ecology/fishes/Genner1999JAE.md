## Title:
Resource control by territorial male cichlid fish in Lake Malawi
## Keywords:
competition, feeding, territoriality
## Geographic Coverage
Lake Malawi, Malawi, Africa
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Interspecific territoriality may reduce competition between species with different diets, thus promoting coexistence and high levels of diversity.

## Notes:
There is high diversity of cichlid fishes in lake Malawi, however all of the species are relatively similar (ecologically), and thus there must be something maintaining competition in order to promote the level of diversity observed.

Tropical damselfish have shown territoriality which promotes competition and controls population size, and competition-driven spatial segregation and site preferences allows for this coexistence.

Hypothesis: territorial males restrict food resource access through exclusion of species with similar diets.  These males would chase conspecific and heterospecific individuals with similar diets, and 'tolerate' heterospecific individuals of a different species.

Conducted SCUBA survey, fish were identified by coloration.  territory was defined as the space within a 70cm quadrat, and males were observed for 10 minutes to look for 1) each introducing individual that the male chased 2) each individual entering the quadrat in 1 min intervals was ID'd.

Results

Males of both species chased both sexes of their own species significantly more than expected.  The two species differed in chasing heterospecifics with the same complex, with one species chasing other species significantly more, and the other significantly less.  For heterospecifics with different complex, both species chased significantly less, and those other species were in their territory significantly more.

Territorial males of both species restrict access of their territory to conspecific individuals, and thus should benefit.  Conspecific females who are not chosen for mating are also excluded.

Fish showed less aggression towards males with different complexes then themselves.  However, this doesn't mean they don't compete for food, but because of different physiology, may take advantage of different areas of the algal mat, thus limiting competition.

Differences between the two fishes may be due to the potential food sources of both (one being a greater specialist than the other).  Having a generalist diet helps limit competition and intensity of competition.
