## Significance:
Investigating the mechanisms of group behavior response to environmental gradients in fish.

## Notes:
Organisms improve decision-making by collectively pooling individual estimates.  We don't know how grouping enhances sensing capabilities.

Used schooling fish that prefer shade for experiments, exploring the role of group size during gradient detection work.  Light fields (dark center, light at edges) were projected into tank, and shaded patch moved at a constant speed through the tank.  Looked a performances of groups with 2 - 2^8 individuals.  Performance was determined by the time-averaged darkness level of the location of the fish (how well they do is how dark an area they were in on average).

Performance increased as a function of group size, and while fish always sought the dark spots, larger groups were more effective.  Strong correlation between swim speed and light level (faster when brighter).

Acceleration of individuals was more strongly influenced by the location of conspecifics than the environmental gradient.  When neighbors were all in the same direction relative to an individual, social influence entirely outweighed the environment.  The location of near-neighbors is a better predictor of an individuals motion than the location of the dark region (stimulus).

Mechanism 1: variation in speed among fish within a group corresponds with the variation in light level (fish on the outer, brighter areas swim faster, turning the group to the left into the dark).  Mechanism 2: As individuals slow, the local density increases as a function of darkness.

They modeled grouping individuals and found similar results.  Groups that span larger areas show a variation across the gradient and a greater change in speed through the group.

Collective dynamics of individual kinesis results in group level responses that don't exist at the individual level.
