## Significance:
Lab tests showing that speed and accuracy of predator avoidance increase as a function of group size.

## Notes:
Social animals need to make collective decisions about moving together, food, and awareness of predators.  The accuracy of decision making increases with group size to a point before leveling off.

Many-eyes theory: predators will be detected sooner by larger groups, increasing their ability to escape for the individual that detects them and other group members as the information is transmitted.  However little is known about the mechanism of the decision-making.  If one individual initiates a response, it will proliferate through the group.  Speed and accuracy of decision increase because (a) there are more likely to be more individuals better at spotting predators and (b) there is less space for an individual to be responsible scanning.

Hypothesis: Larger groups make faster and more accurate decisions than smaller groups/individuals.

Based on observations, they produced a model equation where the probability of at least on individual spotting the predator is a function of the size of the group.  In the "decision-making" zone, swimming speed increased as a function of group size, and time spent in both the approach and decision-making zone decreased.

Possible that the improvement in decision making is due to social facilitation of predator detection with group size, not diversity of individuals, thus the area required to scan by an individual decreases with size, as observed by a decrease in frequency of direction changed by focal fish.  There is also a strong spatial association with communication, where "companion" individuals were more likely to avoid the predator.

Single fish likely experience greater uncertainty in a new environment because they have to gather all the relevant information themselves.

Observations are consistent with a local radius in which information is shared.  Group diversity does not explain the increased accuracy in decision making and that many eyes is facilitated by self vigilance, communicating across the group.

No evidence of game-theory behavior, rather an increase in efficiency in high cooperation.
