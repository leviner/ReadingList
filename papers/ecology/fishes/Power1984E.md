## Notes:
Predation and food limitation are alternatively proposed factors of population limitation but are interacting, e.g., if prey stay "safe" but deplete their food source, they are prey limited, but if they venture out and get eaten, they appear predator limited.
Stream communities can be depth-specific when it comes to feeding in order to avoid predation, affecting their habitat use. 
This paper described the depth distribution of catfish under different predation risk (day/night) in relation to depth-dependent food availabiloity.

Methods
- Measured the distribution of piscivorous birds, catfish in surveys.  Measured the depth of water (and wading depth), and algal density (dry mass) of feeding locations of birds in the stream.
- Fish were surveyed in quadrats during various snorkelling census during two day and two night periods.  Fish lengths were estimated.

Larger loricariids occur in deeper water, with smaller species in shallower areas.  Larger fish move into shallow areas at night. Trends between dry and wet seasons are fairly flat, and depths occupied do not appear to change seasonally.

During the dry season, some species lose or maintain mass.  Early flooding of the west season gives fish new access to algae, resulting in signficantly faster growth, which declines but remains positive in the late wet season.

Fish were marked to determine mortality, though no seasonal trends in "disappearance rate" was observed.

The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that loricariids avoid areas where they would be susceptible to birds, even when food is limiting.  

Wading and diving birds are moset effective in shallow waters.  Some of the piscivorous birds feed at night, and the largest species of fish only exhibit small (10cm) shifts in vertical distribution at night.

In shallow waters, many smaller species can hid within areas of stones, while larger fish (6-7cm) now exhibit armor and spines that may aid in avoidance.

Natural predation of smaller fishes by larger fish also occurs, further differentiating the habitat of fish of different size classes.



Possible hypotheses:
- Avoidance of depth strata of their most common predators
- For small fishes, occupy shallow areas to take advantage of higher algae standing crops
- Larger fish may avoid physical gradients (temperature, oxygen), though this is unlikely
- Depth gradients of algae suggest fish become increasingly food limited as they grow and move deep
