## Title:
Predation strategies of larval clownfish capturing evasive copepod prey
## Keywords:
feeding, behavior, predator-prey, larval fish
## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:

## Significance:
Observe and quantify the feeding success and failure of larval fish as a function of both fish age (day post-hatch) and copepod stage.

## Notes:
Individual models are important for predicting animal recruitment success, though they are difficult to parameterize.

Transition to feeding is a critical point in growth/success of larval fishes, and foraging models are typically focused on predator-prey encounter rates which highlight how match-mismatch in abundances and encounter rates impact growth and survival, but ignore post-encounter outcomes.  This paper examines the kinematics of clownfish predation on copepods.

Copepods, the main prey of larval fish, can be highly evasive, and there is low prey capture rates particularly among smaller larval fish.  Post-encounter success was measured as a function of larval fish age and copepod developmental stage.

Larval fish were fed rotifers or copepods, which were grown in batches to have multiple stages.  A high speed camera (single) was used to capture footage of the feeding attempts.  Two types of experiments were done:
  - An experiment to determine what day post-hatch fish started to capture adult copepods
  - behavioral experiments using 4 stages of copepods with fish of different age groups post-hatch

Video analysis was done to track the tip of the fish's mouth and the center of the copepod.  Behavioral measurements were classified and measured for 3 categories, using different frame rates to make measurements at each one:
- Approach phase, when the fish is positioning itself towards prey
- Positioning of the body before strike
- Strike when mouth is opened and lunge occurs

Copepod measurements were also tracked to identify any escape behavior relative to the timing of the strike.

Results
- Fish were successful at capturing prey, beginning at 1 dph.
- 243 strikes were recorded, of which 156 were successful (64%), the remaining failed or escape occured
- Larval fish did not successfully capture adult cops until 7 dph, and fish from 6 - 9 dph attempted to capture all prey classes, fish > 9 dph no longer targeted nauplii and fish > 12 dph no longer targeted early copepodites

Five behavioral markers were identified during feeding: 1) reorientation towards food 2) intial approach with normal swim mechanics 3) slower "sculling" approach without using caudal fin 4) final positioning and 5) strike.  

Successful strikes
- Final approach phase was short, < .5-1 s, with older fish taking ~40% less time to "set up" the attack
- Swim speeds during the sculling phase were slow and steady, and increased in speed as a function of prey size (larger copepod, faster/shorter sculling)
- Strike distance was typically 1mm from prey
- Capture of prey occurred simultaneously with peak speed
- Strikes became more coordinated, shortening in time over all with age of fish

Copepod Evasion
- 50% of strikes by larval fish were accompanied by an attempted escape
- Misses by fish where escapement behavior did not occur was very rare (n=8)
- Escapees increase as a function of stage
- Capture was successful 40% of the time when an escape response was initiated
- Adult cops were both more likely and more successful

Larval fish strategy for feeding involves two tradeoffs: 1) very slow approach as to not alert the prey while minimizing the probability of relocation jump by the copepod and 2) minimizing the strike distance without eliciting an escape response.  These are both dependent on the age/size of both the prey and predator

"Large decreases in capture success accompanying a copepodâ€™s improving evasiveness with develop- mental stage have been demonstrated experiment...despite the fact that fish larvae improved their predatory abilities with age, capture success was lower in older larvae that targeted adult copepods, instead of nauplii or copepodites."
