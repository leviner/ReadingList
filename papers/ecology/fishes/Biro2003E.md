## Significance:
Whole lake studies of rainbow trout where they conclude that mortality due to predation depends largely on food-dependent risk taking rather than predator density.

## Notes:
Bottom up (individual) based modeling approaches, rather than top down can better address complexity and determine what level of detail is needed to describe the dynamics of a population.

Studies that suggest population-level consequences of predator avoidance are usually based on small scale experiments, so it is unclear which aspects of this antipredation behavior most impact the population and community.  Small scale experiments typically overestimate responses that would normally be observed in situ.  The authors advocate for "whole system" experiments.

Conducted whole lake experiments using "high" and "normal" food conditions for age-0 rainbow trout, with a baseline input of adults as even predation pressure.  They expected that a trade-off between food acquisition and mortality is a function of foraging, and thus increased food leads to decreased mortality due to decreased use of risky habitat to seek food.  Expect a relatively small change in adult fish to have a significant impact.

Gillnetted all the fish out of lakes, then restocked from hatchery.  Lakes were fertilized to support algal growth and thus promote zooplankton growth, zooplankton were measured through repeat sampling at 6 sites covering the various zones of each lake.

Fish were observed directly to measure behavior, noting displacement and habitat use at a series of preset stations within each lake at regular intervals.

Results
- Daphnid abundance increased significantly with fertilization.
- Risk of encountering adults was higher in deep habitats than shallow, with adult populations increasing significantly as a function of depth and unaffected by fertilization.
- Individual trout appeared to be less active in fertilized lakes, spending a smaller proportion of time moving, and swimming at slower speeds
- Swimming speed and time of age 0s did not appear to vary with size of adult stock or proximity of adult fish
- Ag-0 fish used shallow areas more in high-food than low-food earlier in the season, and became less defined later in the year.
- Mortality was significantly linked to fertilizer treatment, with significantly higher mortality in the unfertilized lakes, and the introduction of large adults into both treatment conditions had little effect on mortality rate.

Conclusions
1. Fertilization increased the zooplankton population
2. Acitivity of age-0 fish was lower in the high zooplankton (fertilized) Lakes
3. Age-0 trout restrict their distribution to shallow areas were food is lower but predation is lower.  More pronounced when food is high
4.  Mortality was much lower in fertilized lakes, and slightly higher mortality in lakes with large adults could be due to (a) more efficient predation by larger fish or (b) overall increase in density of predators

Lack of change in growth could be attributed to selection for rapid growth to avoid size-dependent predation, increased foraging effort and risk taking would be expected (resulting in observed mortality).

"Here, we provide evidence that it is possible to predict the mortality of prey popula- tions at the scale of whole systems with a relatively simple notion of how prey trade off growth and mor- tality rates, via their foraging behavior"
