Traditionality of mating-site preferences in a coral reef fish
## Keywords:
mating, tradition, resource
## Geographic Coverage
San Blas Islands, Panama
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Observations of traditionalism in wrasse who appear establish mating territories based on traditional sites rather than resource assessment.

## Notes:
Bluehead wrasse consistently use the same reef sites for territores/spawning, regardless of excess sites.  Here, they relocated populations of fish to determine if consistency in site usage is due to traditionality or resource assessment.  If resources, the newly transplanted populations would use the old site.  Traditionality would mean the new sites come into use and persist after manipulation.  Control populations were removed then placed back on their same reefs.

This was conducted on 6 reefs, and the results are consistent with traditionality, sites that were previously used were no more likely to be used than any other site that fit the baseline physical criteria, and have continued to be used.

Under natural circumstances, mating site locations to not appear to be chosen by individual assessment but by cultural transmission of traditional sites.  Once broken, a new site can be used and becomes the tradition.

This traditional behavior is advantageous for young fish when dispersing into new habitat.  Females also appear to learn male sites from other females, and will mate only at established sites if there's native females, and establish new sites if native males are present.

Time and safety gained through tradition may outweigh benefits of careful assessment.
