## Significance:
Tries to detangle the role of social and asocial forcings, and the mechanisms of why fish school through exploration of previous model development and their own.

## Notes:
Types of Aggregations
- Ranging from territorial animals with little need to communicate information to others to highly integrated long-term associations between individuals.
- In these integrated groups, long term communication may supplement immediate sensory contact, and thus they remain integrated even when dispersed.
- Between these extremes are herds/swarms/flocks/schools, where there is coordinated motion but possibly unrelated and non-lasting relationships, and individuals mostly interact within neighborhoods.
- Behavioral adaptations could be due to 1) short term reactions to change position relative to neighbors and 2) behavioral response that may contribute to group level changes, thereby benefitting the individual.

Pattern vs. Function
- Pattern may confer evolutionary advantages in difference situations, and do these behaviors cause a trade-off between short term individual gain and long term function of the group?

Traffic Rules - How is pattern maintained?
- Modeling allows us to distinguish the cause and effect in terms of organization, associating decisions and movements, focused on 3 categories:
  - behavioral matching: individual matches to the nearest behavior
  - positional preference: each individual has a preferred position relative to its neighbors, such as distance zones and relative angle
  - numerical preference: how many neighbors and individual pays attention to
- Most models use relatively small populations and operate in 2 dimensions, and assume individuals are identical
- Little consensus on what indicies of school characteristics are most biologically relevant, and present them at the individual, group, and population level.

Simulation study
- Modeling a 3d group of fish based on sum of locomatory, social, and random forces, based on schooling giant dainos, looking at populations from 2-128 fish.
- asocial (randomness, drag) factors had less of an affect than social forcings.  Drag increased the group size by slowing fish down, and the larger groups tended to mill more than move forward.
- Social forces: Numerical preference has strong effect, and neighbor scaling factor influenced group size.  The higher number of influential neighbors increases school size at the expense of structure (more collisions).
- At relatively low neighbor numbers, nearest neighbor distances do not change, until the number of influential neighbors becomes very large, at which point the relationship breaks down.
- School cohesion and coordination can be achieved by numerical and positional preferences without matching behaviors.

Emergent evolution
- Emergent properties may be tied with behavioral adaptations which only indirectly benefit the individual through the group.  Does the group behavior benefit the members because of their membership?
