## Title:
To boldly go: Individual differences in boldness influence migratory tendency
## Keywords:
boldness, migration, personality
## Geographic Coverage
Lake Krankesjon, Sweden
## Field Dates:
09/01/2009 - 09/30-2010
## Significance:
Investigating the role of boldness in determining which individuals migrate in a partially migrating species.  Individual predation vulnerability, higher in bold fish, possibly the main factor driving the decision to migrate.

## Notes:
Many species only undergo partial migration, thought to be an early evolutionary stage of full migration.  The primary question is why do some individuals migrate while others do not?  

A goal is to understand the evolutionary consequences of an individual's propensity to take risk (boldness).  Here, they investigate if different personalities result in different migration strategies. They hypothesize that individual differences in predation vulnerability explain which fish migrate, and bold fish may be more likely to be in areas of higher predation risk.

Fish were captured in a lake, brought to a lab, and tested for boldness using a refuge emergence protocol.  Fish were then tagged and released back into the lake.  Migration between the lake and the streams was monitored.

There was a significant relationship between boldness and body length with propensity to migrate (individually significant, not interacting).  Bolder individuals and fish with a lower body length had a greater likelihood of migrating.  No relationship was found between boldness and body length.

Bold animals have additional risks, with high individual predation vulnerability (IPV) which may drive the differences in migration.  During the winter when food is scarce, bold individuals may benefit more through migration, as predation risk to food ratio increases.  Same is probably true for the small fish, which are more favorable to gape-limited piscivorous pike, and thus have greater IPV.

Alternatively, bolder animals may be more likely to explore unknown environments and thus increase likelihood of migration.

Interannual changes in migrating animals between years appears to be driven by temperatures, with more fish migrating following warmer summers (plasticity may be driven by temperature).
