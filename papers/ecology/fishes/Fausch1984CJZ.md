## Keywords:

## Significance:
Salmon select focal points based on water-velocity and food supply to maximize net gain, and in specific regions, further organization is dictated by hierarchies in which dominant fish hold more optimal positions and thus increase their growth rates.

## Notes:
Stream salmonids remain relatively in the same position, should maximize position where they can balance expending low energy (low flow) and maximize invert (food) drift (high flow).  Here, they define a model of "profit" base don position and relate specific growth rates to that profit.

Experiments were conducted by putting fish (3 with salmon, 2 with brown trout, 1 with brook trout) in a stream aquarium where flow could be maintained based on maximum swim speed of the fish.  Daphnia were introduced continuously throughout the light cycle.  Fish were acclimated for 4 days then the experiment occurred for 18 days.  Fish were marked, measured and weighed before and after each experiment, drift of daphnia was measured at a cross section of the stream, and profit at a position was determined to be the available energy of the drift minus the energy cost of being there, determined from general metabolic equations for each species.  Fish position was recorded by marking the tank.

Results
- Energy available to fish was determined to be a linear function, where drift energy is a function of water velocity, where the slope is dependent on the distance downstream, which can be retermed where drift energy is a function of fish body length, distance downstream froni the food source (x), and water velocity (V).
- Results from the experiments roughly fit this Michaelis-Menten curve, where specific growth rate is a log function of mean potential profit based on location.
- Brown trout when forced into high velocity would settle on bottom, while salmon did not, and would also wedge themselves into gravel.

Salmon quickly established hierarchy to compete for position, and potential profit was a better predictor for salmon than other fish.  Hypothesized that within the region where the fish interact, they compete for optimal positions, thus hierarchy should be reflected in less potential profit.  Fish linear ranking directly matches the ranking by specific growth rates.  "dominant fish that maximize potential profit also maximize fitness"
