The Adaptive Significance of Interspecific Territoriality in the Reef Fish Eupomacentrus Leucostictus
## Keywords:
competition, predation, territoriality
## Geographic Coverage
U.S. Virgin Islands
## Field Dates:
01/12/1974 - 05/08/1974
## Significance:
Both food resource and nest defense are prominent functions of interspecific territoriality

## Notes:
Hypotheses:
- Interspecific territoriality functions to preserve refuge
- ...functions to protect food resource from competitors
- ...functions to protect eggs
- ...is nonadaptive, an error in species identification by the observer

Individuals in territories were observed at 10 shallow water sites which included a refuge (crevice, cavity).  territories were recorded for fish prior to counting trespasses.  Only fish with known feeding habits were included in analyses.

If food resource is the primary function, then those fish with the greatest diet overlap would elicit the most agonism.  There was in fact a significant correlation between diet overlap and agonsim.

If nest defense is the primary function, then egg-eating fish would encounter the most agonism, which was significantly correlated and had a strong relationship.  

Minimal attention was given to conspecifics, and thus is likely not nonadaptive (aka, there is a choice, it is not random or a function of observation error)

The importance of nest vs. food: It is possible that the fitness of the territory-holder can be reduced more by a small amount of egg predation than a large amount of food competition.

Territoriality may also be to protect their choice of refuge, then smaller fish that can fit in the hole would be more likely to be attacked, however no relationship existed.
