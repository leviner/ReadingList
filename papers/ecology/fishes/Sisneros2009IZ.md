## Notes:
Vocal batrachoidid are good models for looking at auditory mechanism in vertebrates.  These fish have evolved a seasonal enhancement of mate detection during breeding.

Vocal and reproductive behavior
- Two types of male fishes, one of which produces nests and produces a long duration advertisement call using sonic muscles attached to the swim bladder.  The call is a hum with high harmonics that may be important for detection.  Females will be attracted to the calls, spawn, leave their eggs with the male, who will continue to court other females.
- Males and females both produce grunts during agnostic encounters, typically used to fend of nest intruders.
- Type 1 males also produce a "growl", which is a grunt followed by a hum, typically heard at the beginning of breeding season when establishing nests.

Midshipman auditory system
- resting discharge activity and auditory thresh- old sensitivity at best excitatory frequency increase with age/size
- saccular afferents of juveniles are best suited for the low-frequency vocalizations of Midshipman

Seasonal plasticity in frequency sensitivity
- During late spring/early summer, midshipman migrate from offshore to the intertidal.  Type 1 males acoustically court females, which exhibit a strong phototactic response to the hum.
- The auditory suystem of females had a higher best excitatory frequency during the summer months, thus better suited to detect the higher harmonic components of the male hum, improving the conspecific mate detection and localization.
- "In sum, the summer enhancement of the frequency response properties of the saccular afferents may represent an adaptive plasticity of the female midshipmanâ€™s auditory system to improve detection of the multi-harmonic hums and enhance the acquisition of auditory information for mate identifica- tion, recognition and localization during the breeding season."

Steroid dependent modulation
- 4 phases of the year: non-reproductive, pre-nesting, nesting, and post-nesting.  During pre-nesting, there is an increase in estradiol and testosterone which may induce the seasonal enhancement of the auditory system even in a non-reproductive individual, which was found to be true.
- Steroid induced changes were strongest at the highest frequencies of harmonics.
- The mechanisms of the steroidal enhancement is unknown.  Gonadal steroids may effect the hair cell kinetics and electrical resonance which drives frequency sensitivity

Future work
- Investigate the mechanism of steroidal enhancement, looking at the receptor potential of saccular hair cells in the inner ear
- It may also be impacted at the level of the auditory neuron
- It is not known whether the males also exhibit this type of plasticity.
