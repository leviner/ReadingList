## Notes:
Kin recognition and preference, Lab studies
- Many species of fish have been observed to recognize kin, with a lot of studies on salmon and the use of olfactory elements, such as odor cues.
- Some fish such as sticklebacks have been observed to preferentially associate with siblings as juveniles, even when isolated at the egg stage, thus innate.
- Female rainbowfish differentiated between kin and nonkin males when associating, possibly to reduce inbreeding.

Mechanisms of recognition
- Phenotypic signals (chemical or visual) are noticed, compared to a "template" to ID kin.  The "template" may be innate or learned during a period of development.
- Kin recognition may depend on early association, and thus those raised with both kin and nonkin are unable to differentiate, or when raised in isolation.
- Some fishes, when raised with heterospecifics, prefer to associate with those rather than unfamiliar conspecifics.
- Some fish transmit chemical cues through urine.
- New research shows polymorphic glycoprotein coders which affect the odor of the carrier, thus allowing for recognition.

Advantages of recognition and kin association
- Avoiding the cost of inbreeding and maintaining levels of outbreeding to optimize genetic variation.
- Inclusive fitness: maintaining optimal group size for shoals for producing alerts, levels of aggression (and thus time spent defending).
- At high levels of competition, it may be advantageous to increase genotypic variability.

Importance of Relatedness
- currently lack of evidence in kin selection from the field, might be due to animals being hatched and reared together, and thus little discrimination between kin and familiar individuals.

Familiarity
- The potential for the ability to recognize familiars may be dependent on the social dynamics of a species.
- Mechanisms: based on the discrimination of visual or chemical cues, studies have shown that it may be chemical alone in some cases, and thus there is no limit to the number of familiars that can be recognized by an individual.
- Fish with a similar recent habitat exploitation who are nonfamiliar may have similar odor cues.
- In work on guppies, a study showed individual recognition, and thus there would be an upper limit (memory).
- May also be linked to sex, where males/females show a preference for same-sex familiars

Advantages of familiars
- Antipredation: shoal more cohesively in the presence of a predator, and the production/investment in creation of epithelial alarm cells.
- Natural selection would favor a reduction in aggression behavior.
- Spread of information more efficiently due to increased familiarity of signals through interactions
- Mate choice and distribution of reproductive effort in fish that may prefer to mate with unfamiliar fish.

Importance
- Few observations have been observed in the field, though in the lab there are many examples of non-random assortment of familiar fish within shoals.

Kin group occurrence is partly a function of life history, and the development of recognition templates may result in familar development as well.  If familiarity is a good predictor of relatedness in some communities, kin selection may not occur/be necessary.
