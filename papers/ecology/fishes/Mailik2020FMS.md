## Title:

## Significance:
Used habitat characteristics and temperature, including a lead time (i.e., conditions from the previous 8 months) to predict hake distribution.

## Notes:
Pacific hake are seasonally migratory, and their summer distribution is influenced by environmental conditions, particularly temperature, where thermal condition has been found to be associated with the northern extent of stock location, particularly at the northern extent of their distributon in canadian waters. Thus temperatures could be a useful predictor of the northern extent of the hake stock. Here they look to see if seasonal oceanographic forecasts can be used to predict hake distribution.

Forecasts are useful for:
- Allocating limited survey efforts
- Provide information on trans-boundary distribution (US vs. Canada waters) and regions outside of the survey domain
- Provide early warnings of potential shifts

They used 7 years of hake acoustic-trawl surveys between 43 and 50 N. An 8-month lead time forecast of temperature at 250m from JSCOPE was used for the seasonal physical. They used reforecast to both measure the accuracy at predicting hake and the observed ocean condition. In addition to temperature, the prediction included and index of cross-shelf location relative to the 200m isobath (inshore vs. offshore).

They tested two model forms: a GAM model and a boosted regression tree, which included both temp, cross-shelf index, and lat/lon as predictors. LOO cross validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the hake distributions. JSCOPE predictions were evaluated against in situ observations as an addition to the previous evaluation metrics. The bottom temperatures matched well (R2=0.88) with the observations.

All models showed the hake to be slightly offshore, with hake having a positive response to warm anomalies. All models performed well in predicting hake distribution, with the strongest driver in all models being the cross-shelf index, though performance dropped with the removal of temperature, thus a moderate subsurface temperature impact on hake distribution. The consistency of hake both in-/offshore and north to south (fewer gaps) within a given year increase the model prediction.
