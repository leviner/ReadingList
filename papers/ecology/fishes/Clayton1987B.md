## Significance:
Shows the impact of compressibility (increasing density) on territoriality through the use of mudwalls to define spaces and limit aggression between neighbors.

## Notes:
In featureless environments, substrate construction can be used as signals for exclusion.

B. boddarti are amphibious gobiid which are territorial and build walls of mud to define their territories.  Hypothesis: These walls may also serve to limit aggression between neighbors.

Active burrow systems were made (wall, no wall, and polygonal territories).  To see if mudwalls were acting as physical or just visual barriers, a strait portion of the mudwall was removed and replaced with wood, something clear, or nothing.  Walls in a single territory were set with single or multiple conditions.  Behavior of fish before and after modification was recorded, both intruder and resident response.

You can identify the wall builder by observing which fish had mud in its mouth. About half of the walls were reconstructed by both fish.

With increasing population density (and thus decrease neighbor distance), more mudwalls were constructed.  

In most cases, mud walls were rebuilt where spaces or perspex were left, but not where hardboard was placed.  Perspex walls were effective and eventually mud covered, usually some partial mud building occurred, and fish "jostled" through the glass.

The removal of a mud wall had no effect on the number of chases, but rather on the number of chases directed at the neighbor with which the wall had been removed.  After removal, neighbors appeared to be more likely to ignore each other.  This avoidance also accounts for adjacent burrow systems without a separating mud wall in low density areas.

When population levels are low, fishes don't build walls, and these distances naturally decrease with increasing density.  The mud walls mostly serve as a visual barrier to reduce agnostic behavior rather than.
