## Keywords:
recreational fishing, selection
## Geographic Coverage
Ridge Lake, Illinois, USA
## Field Dates:

## Significance:
Long-term breeding study showing that vulnerability to recreational angling in largemouth bass is an inheritable trait.

## Notes:
Harvest-induced selection due to recreational angling is poorly studied.  Vulnerability to angling varies by taxa.  Hypotheses previously offered are 1) evolutionary differences, 2) differences in excitability, 3) differences in weariness and learning ability.  Evolutionarily, intraspecific differences in vulnerability are more important that interspecies, where some individuals learn avoidance or are more naive, and previous angling has selected against catchability.

Hypothesis: if vulnerability to angling does have a heritable component, removing the vulnerable individuals will decrease the average vulnerability of a population, with the possibility to alter the behavior and catchability of fish.

Total number of catches (per fishing effort) was determined for fish of different breeding lines.

High vulnerability lines of fish were much more likely to be caught than the low vulnerability lines, in as early as the first generation.  There does appear to be an increase in the ratio of fish caught between generations.  Differences became more apparent with increased hours of fishing effort as a saturation appeared to be reached in the LV lines.  When normalized, there appears to be no difference across generations of the HV with a significant decrease in the LV lines.

It is apparent that vulnerability is a hereditable trait, and thus recreational angling could cause evolutionary impacts on species.  They suggest that the inability to recognize such significant changes in the wild (i.e., why haven't recreational bass landings decreased significantly) is likely due to the improvement in fishing technology.

The question still remains what the mechanism is that leads to these changes in vulnerability.  One possibility could be an individual's level of aggression that leads it to attack a lure.  

The authors emphasize that management should take this into consideration, and the selective breeding of varying vulnerability in fish should not be used to either increase fishing or balance fishing efforts.
