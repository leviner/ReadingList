## Title:
Diel Vertical Migration by Juvenile Sockeye Salmon: Empirical Evidence for the Antipredation Window
## Keywords:
migration, feeding, predation, behavior, foraging
## Geographic Coverage
Wood River, Alaska, USA
## Field Dates:
07/08/2000 - 09/01/2000
## Significance:
Juvenile sockeye migrate to maintain a specific light environment to minimize predation risk in lakes.

## Notes:
Three hypotheses proposed for DVM:
- bioenergetic efficiency: vertical temperature gradient, thus they select for growth, migrating to cold when not feeding
- foraging opportunity: fish track prey in space and time
- predator avoidance: move in response to piscivores.

How does light effect both the predators and prey?  Antipredation window - visual range that minimizes predation risk while maximizing foraging.

Hypothesis: sockeye would change their behavior to match the changes in light environment to best exploit the antipredation window.

They did hydroacoustic surveys (200kHz) in July and September in 3 lakes in the river system, measuring the salmon, prey, and predator distributions (dB classification), and sampled the fish and zooplankton.  Estimated foraging as a function of reaction time, swim speed, and density of zooplankton, and predation risk as a function of swim speed, depth, and reactive distance.

DVM occured in all lakes.  If the fish were merely tracking temperature, then they would likely remain much shallower since the thermocline was 30-40 meters shallower than the fish, and the energy costs of migration would outweigh the metabolic advantage of minimal temperature change.  

No change in zooplankton distribution between night and day, only the salmon.

Light levels were overall lower in the later sampling.  Ratio of predation risk to foraging changed between the July and September sampling.  In late-summer, light levels are low enough to inhibit foraging, thus limiting the window of time (light) where foraging outweighs predation.  This time, when risk/foraging ratio is near zero, aligns with when migration path crosses layer of highest predator density.
