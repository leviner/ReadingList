## Title:
Uninformed Individuals Promote Democratic Consensus in Animal Groups
## Keywords:
behavior, collective decisions, movement, self-interest
## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:

## Significance:
In the presence of a strongly opinionated majority, the introduction of naive (unbiased) individuals helps to return group decision making to the majority

## Notes:
In herding/schooling of unrelated animals such as fishes, self-interest can influence group decisions. In some cases decisions of an individual or small group can dictate the entire group. Consensus could also be reached by democratic means which may minimize consensus costs.

Individuals who are uninformed are more likely to be influenced by those strongly opinionated.

Whether and under what conditions a strongly-opinionated minority can influence group movement decisions. They find uninformed individuals play a key role in democratic consensus.

They model animals in simple nearest-neighbor alignment and rules, where there are two groups that have preferred topics.

In live testing with golden shiners, they found a minority of fish trained to have a preferred target, an increase in the number of uninformed individuals eventually returns the decision to majority preference rather than those opinionated.
