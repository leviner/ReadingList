An overview, given by Fausch, of the development of his drift foraging model and expansion and extended applications that have occurred since.

## Notes:
Chapman et al 1966 describe optimal feeding stations, where in streams, fish can't directly defend the food that is drifting by, rather they have to defend the position near the faster water that provides them greater opportunity to have food come to them.

However, this is not independent of energy (Everest and Chapman 1972), because you have to expend energy at different rates depending on the velocity.  The in 1969, Jenkins found there was a hierarchy, and removal of the dominant fish led to a shift up in all the fish remaining.

Fausch describes his masters research, measuring positions of native brook trout by snorkeling in a stream before and after removal of nonnative fish, finding that the nonnative kept the native fish from their favorable resting positions.

The basis of the research that would lead to the 1984 paper was how the introduction of nonnative coho into the great lakes would impact the fish in the tributaries.  Models were already made for predicting optimal swim speeds to maximize energy gain, but this needed to be altered since many stream fish hold refuge in velocities slower than they feed.  Based on pilot studies, Fausch found that fish tended to feed within a 2x body length radius at the fastest velocity.

Mechalis-Menten curves had not yet been used to fit for vertebrates, and found that fish which hold optimal positions (food-wise) grow the fastest.

This model could then be used to test competition.  In the field, coho emerge before trout, but in the lab, when they are dispersed at equal size, there is clear dominance by the coho and even niche shifting of trout to areas away from coho.

His model was further developed by Hughes and proven in the field, where it was used to predict the position of grayling introduced in Arctic streams.

Fausch describes why he thinks his 1984 paper is so well cited, which he believes is due to (a) timeliness, (b) simplicity, (c) the lab results aliged well with theory, and (d) once it had been cited, it would be found by others.

Hughes and Dill (1990) has proved to be robust in fish and other fields, and highlights how the most difficult part to predict is the bioenergetics of the fish prey.  Regardless, drift position theory is successfully used in situ and has been found to be a better predictor of biomass than other habitat variables, and has further applications in habitat conservation restoration and management.
