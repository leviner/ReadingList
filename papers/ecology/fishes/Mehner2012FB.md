Review of patterns and mechanism of DVM in freshwater fish.

## Notes:
Significant work and review has been done on zooplankton DVM, with some work done on marine fish.  Here, the author provides an overview of these patterns in freshwater fish.

Fish that perform DVM have two common traits: they are typically planktivorous, and they require cold/cool water, thus residing in the pelagic zone.  Thermal gradients in lakes, along with other abiotic drivers (which result in biotic gradients) are the cause of migration.  Vertical structure leads to microhabitats.

Proximate cause: sensory-motor and developmental mechanisms, ultimate cause: the evolutionary development of behavior.  
- Main proximate cause: light levels. depths and migration amplitude has correlated with water transparency (clearer water, migrate deeper, more predation risk). Vertical temperature may guide fish at night, looking for energetically optimal locations.
- Ultimate causes are bioenergetics, feeding, and predation. Overall, none of the three following ultimate causes convincingly explain all cases of DVM.
- Bioenergetic efficiency: maintaining low metabolic rate during the day in cold water and move into warmer water to feed.  However, if it was strictly bioenergetics, then they could reverse DVM and have the advantage of visual foraging.  DVM has also been reported in non-stratified lakes with no temperature gradients.  Additionally, fish grow fastest at warmer temperatures when food is not a variable.
- Feeding Opportunity: Following preferred food, thus increasing encounter rate.  However DVM in fish also observed in lakes where zooplankton don't migrate.
- Predator avoidance: Avoiding mortality from visual predators in high light.

Multifactor explanations: 'anti predation window' where the visual predation range of fish and their predators differs, and planktonic fish can forage at lower light than piscivorous fish, thus prey fish move to dark layers in day to continue feeding, following the light window and minimizing predation risk while maximizing foraging potential.  Predation avoidance limits maximum growth potential.

Wile this predicts the depth during the day, it doesn't predict the final position in the water column at night, and is suggested that fish may find bioenergetically optimal temperatures for their final spots and minimize swimming efforts.  A "complex interplay of various factors along several vertical gradients"

Research Gaps: mechanisms
- Energetics of migrations and buoyancy: the energy needed to maintain swimbladder volume and the speed of doing so.  Fish with compressed swim bladders have to produce additional lift (swimming) and exert more energy.  Oxygen requirements also differ with pressure.
- How is tissue growth (and fat storage) influenced by cyclic temperature of DVM?
- Age-specific migrations may depend on ontogenetic thermal preferences.
- Threshold of light needed to feed?  Could be slow/unselective feeding in darkness or lighter feeding overall.  Light thresholds for predators are also needed.  DVM may be dependent on very slight variability in light, including moon.
