## Title:
Predator identity and time of day interact to shape the riskâ€“reward trade-off for herbivorous coral reef fishes
## Keywords:
interaction, predation, risk, behavior, indirect
## Geographic Coverage
Conch Reef, Florida Keys, USA
## Field Dates:
11/01/2013 - 11/08/2013
## Significance:
Herbivorous fish show a threat-sensitive response by decreasing foraging near models of predators, but the effect is dependent on time of day.

## Notes:
Predators can influence ecology through non-consumptive effects (NCEs) by driving tradeoffs in their prey between food and risk.  NCEs can be influenced by the entire ecosystem and physical conditions as well.  Prey often alter their habitat use as a function of habitat conditions (e.g., lighting).

Here, they are interested in how anti-predator responses vary as a function of predator identity and a function of time of day.  Different predators with different hunting strategies impact prey behavior differently.

Measured how herbivory changed as a function of distance from the predator models at different times of day.

Fiberglass models were deployed of grouper (sit and wait) and barracuda (sit and chase) at dawn, midday, and dusk.  Seagrass assays were deployed to asses herbivory.  They previously tested the deployment of the models relative to a control (carboy) to evaluate effectiveness.  Feeding assays were also recorded with cameras.  Estimating ambient predator conditions in video.  Measured total seagrass consumed (direct impact of herbivory) and total bites per hour (as a sign of behavior).

Results
- Across all time and distance, seagrass consumption declined 37% with the barracuda and 30% with the grouper.
- Greatest amount of seagrass consumption occurred at dawn, decreasing at midday and more at dusk.
- Bite rate declined significantly with the barracuda but not grouper.
- Spatially, distance impact varied with time of day for the barracuda model

Barracuda supress foraging nearly twice as much as grouper, and barracuda had a greater 'zone of fear', though this was only apparent midday.  They more strongly suppress foraging at midday and dusk, and the barracuda was more greatly perceived as riskier.

Because of how abundant herbivorous fish are in the reef, it's unlikely that consumptive impacts are having a significant impact on herbivory, and the overwhelming signal is the non-consumptive effects.  The effect of was greater on behavior than consumption.

Spatial differences are likely due to the hunting tactics of the two predators.  Increased light intensity during the day might have allowed the fish to identify the difference between the barracuda and grouper, hence why they were willing to feed closer during the day.  Fish were likely afraid to pursue food closer to a predator that strikes over greater distances.  Dawn activity is likely driven by hunger, thus more likely to engage in risky behavior.

This feeding could have implications for spatial distribution in coral growth, cover, and recruitment.  Predators impact herbivores which impacts algal distribution and growth on coral.
