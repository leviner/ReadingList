## Title:
Coral reef fish smell leaves to find island homes
## Keywords:
dispersal, habitat selection, chemical ecology
## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
02/20/2007 - 04/28/2007
## Significance:
Clownfish appear to have an innate olfactory attraction to rainforest vegetation which could be used to search out suitable habitat on island-associated reefs.

## Notes:
Persistence of coral reef populations requires connectivity of sub-populations and that some portion of juveniles return to their natal reef.  There has been observed self-recruitment, but the mechanism by which fish orient and settle on reefs is unknown.  There is evidence of both auditory and olfactory cues, but the source of those cues is also not known.

Goal is to investigate the role of olfactory cues in the location of island homes in juvenile clownfish.  Hypothesis: juveniles prefer water from reefs with islands over water from reefs without islands, and respond positively to chemical cues from anemones or island vegetation.

They first surveyed fish to determine in situ affinity with island reefs.  They also used a choice flume in situ to compare 1) water from reefs with and without islands 2) water from different distances from island reefs and 3) water treated with anemone or trees and not.  Finally, they conducted a lab experiment with larvae that were reared in the lab to test responses to leaf/anemone influenced water sources.

Results
- Fish had significantly higher densities near the islands
- Strong preference for water samples from reefs wit islands
- Consistently showed preference for beach (nearshore) water
- Fish preferred treated (anemone and leaf) offshore water over non-treated water
- Larvae showed attraction to anemone cues even with no previous exposure to reefs, same with leaf-treated water

Clownfish appear to have an innate olfactory attraction to rainforest vegetation which could be used to search out suitable habitat on island-associated reefs.  Both naive and field experienced fish made similar choices of preference.

Floating leaves and offshore organic debris can expand the olfactory footprint of an island, while anemone cues help hone in at local scales.  It's possible that there is an additional cue that can be imprinted during the embryonic stage that is specific to a certain reef in addition to their ability to sense island associated regions.  This link between fish and rainforest habitat have important consequences is relation to deforestation and coastal development.
