## Significance:
Implications of density on mating success of territorial male reef fishes, showing that decreased density of fish leads to less time defending and thus more time for mating.

## Notes:
Hypothesis: the time and energy allocations of a territorial male depends on the composition and density of the surrounding population.  Mating success should vary inversely with population density.

How does time and energy devoted to interactions with females and other males influence mating success?  An increase in the number of females benefits if the male has time for increased mating activity.  However, an increase in interference from other males resulting in high territorial cost lowers the time available for mating.
- Low population density: a territorial male can have enough time for both defense and mating.  Mating success should increase reflecting the supply of females.
- Higher population densities: they must spend more time defending, thus limiting time for mating.  Mating success should decline.
- Highest densities: territories become undefendable and thus the male abandons the site or becomes nonterritorial.

Animals were recorded for 1) aggression 2) courtship and 3) spawning activities at reefs of different size and densities.

On all but the smallest reef, the number of interfering males strongly affects the defendability of the territories. On the smallest reefs, reduction in population size led to decrease in mating success, while on the larger reefs, led to an increase.  Conversely, increasing population sizes had a negative effect on mating success on larger reefs.

Numbers of male more strongly drive variation in mating success rather than number of available females.  Time spent in defense increases with density of males, and the efficiency of courtship decreases with number of males.

Although mating success of a territorial male may be lowered in high density, it still may be higher than a nonterritorial male.  Up to a point however, where it may be more profitable to seek a mate than remain in place to attract one.
