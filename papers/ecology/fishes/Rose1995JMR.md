## Title:
Cod (Gadus morhua L.) migration speeds and transport relative to currents on the north-east Newfoundland Shelf
## Keywords:
cod, migration, swimming speed, echosounder
## Geographic Coverage
Newfoundland Shelf
## Field Dates:
06/06/1990 - 07/15/1992
## Significance:
Observations of cod migration behavior by tracking agreggations using acoustics. They identify changes in school behavior with seaward/shoreward flow that suggest active transport.

## Notes:
Fish can develop specialized magration behaviors to assist them in certain environmental conditions. However to study migratory behaviors, you have to understand swim speed through the water which requires both fish movement and currents to be known, which are difficult to observe concurrently.

Atlantic cod spawn on the NE Newfoundland shelf in late winter and migrate shoreward to summer feeding grounds. These typically occur along deep basins where warmer water exists. At the beginning of their migration, they move south along with the currents, however once they turn west, the dominant currents may be flowing offshore. Here, they hypothesize that: 1) cod drift when advantageous, 2) cod actively swim against opposing flows and 3) they migrate against these flows. They tracked fish schools during their spring migrations.

Ship-based echosounders were used to continuously survey an agregation by criss-crossing to define the edges of the shoal. Centroids were then calculated as the mean position of the agreggation weighted by the density (CG).  Height off bottom was also recorded. Temperature profiles were taken daily at stations along the migration route within the study area, and the dominant direction of the current was identified by useing the ascent/descent of the 2C isotherm.

Over the 3 years of field studies:
- Cod displacement ranged from 6.6 to 24 km d-1
- ground speeds ranged from 0.08 to 0.28 m s-1
- largest movements along the route corresponded with the largest rise of fish off bottom
- when more sedentary, most fish were within 50m of bottom, and stalling typically coincided with cooler waters.
- daily swim speeds were slightly greater than ground speeds, averaging ~10 cm s-1

Migration rates are slow but highly variable, and food availability and type may also drive changes in speed. These speeds are well below maximum swimming speeds demonstrated in a lab. Cod tended to move along the migration route with the warmer water, and these have previously been seen to be associated with thermal conditions.

Duriing migration, cod moved upward in the water column as expected, which potentially resulted in increased buoyancy and thus reduced energy cost. There were periods when cod moved with the flow and speeds/distrances travelled were above what could be attributed to currents or swimming alone. There are also instances where cod drifted with very low to no swim speed. There was almost no movement across the route, and always directed in the mirgation path.

When flows were seaward, cod did not retreat with the flow, but were observed to stay closer to the bottom (active transport). There was no evidence of cod trying to advance during these seaward flows. Energetically, active transport may be advantageous. After not feeding through winter, the fish are in poor condition and need the energetic savings of utilizing transport.

The ability to discern the centroids of the population varied among years and becomes more difficult with school fragmentation. Fish att the front of the migration appear to be larger. However despite the day-to-day variation in location, it was possible to identify the migration routes and these larger route behaviors were observable across years. The water conditions appear to be relativelye stable year to year as well, and thus the axis of movement reflects the current.

They end by discussing that these routes could also be learned, and thus persistence may be important as he younger fish follow the smaller fish, regardless of if we think they can identify the clues. The evidence for this is the cross-track "error" of fish moving perpendicular to the route, which appeared to be age-associated (i.e., younger fish "wander").
