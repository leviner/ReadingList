## Significance:
Observations testing the selection by females of a non-ancestral trait in males.

## Notes:
Little data exists to support female preference and coevolution of male traits. Hypothesis: preexisting biases result in the evolution of a male trait.  To demonstrate this, it has to be shown that:
- the female choice is based on variation (either natural or not)
- the absence of the preferred trait in males is the ancestral trait
- females prefer the trait even though it was not present in evolutionary history

Swordlessness is the ancestral state, so they wanted to test whether the preference for the swordlike structure is in the primitive state. Choice tests were conducted in an aquarium to observe how much time a female spent courting with each test male.  Males were surgically given either a yellow sword or a clear sword (to account for behavioral changes).  Females showed clear preference for the male with the surgically placed sword.  Upon switching the swords of the two fish, female preference switched with them.

This shows females exhibit a bias towards a non-ancestral trait.  Only traits that lie within the detection limit of the females can be selected for.  The sword could increase perceived body size, thus the selection bias may be for size.  Alternatively, the rare trait can be selected for, until a point where it is no longer rare due to preferential selection (thus preference for novelty is unlikely).

It appears the preference for the sword evolved before the sword itself, and the sword may then have propogated as a result of this bias.  However they cannot discount coevolutionary processes.
