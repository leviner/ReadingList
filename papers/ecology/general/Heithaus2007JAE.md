## Title:
State-dependent risk-taking by green sea turtles mediates top-down effects of tiger shark intimidation in a marine ecosystem
## Keywords:
predation, behavior, conservation, risk
## Geographic Coverage
Shark Bay, Australia
## Field Dates:
03/01/1999 - 08/31/2006
## Significance:
Found that sea turtles in better condition were more likely to move out of regions of higher food quality when risk of predation increased.  Shark presence has non-lethal implications on the turtle and thus the seagrass population.

## Notes:
The paper describes how behavior leads to mechanistic non-lethal top down control by sharks through multiple trophic levels.

Non-lethal effects (changes in habitat use, activity level, or diet) can have large impacts on prey populations and change foodweb dynamics.  There is also a difficulty in assesing how much an individual level trait should be included/impact community models.  Risk taking decisions maybe different for long-living species.

Because of high temporal variability in the top predator (shark) but stable population sizes of lower trophic levels (turtles/dugongs, and their food), Shark Bay can be used to look at influence of temporal variation in risk.

Methods
- Turtles were captured, measured, assigned a condition, and tagged
- Looked at habitat selection and foraging locations of turtles (which varies spatially)
- Classified predation temporally based on shark presence in the bay
- Bank edges have lower food quality, farther from edge increase in quality but also predation risk

Results
- Turtles in good condition were found closer to the bank edges, and that trend stengthened with increased predation risk.  Turtles in fair/poor conditions did not move in high/low risk, but turtles in good/v.good condition moved closer to the bank

Condition-dependent risk avoidance suggests that predation risk influences turtle population size and thus intensity of herbivory.  This has differential impacts on the turtle population (e.g., females post-breeding are in poorer condition and must seek better food, increasing their risk and possibly suffer higher mortality).  Avoidance (moving to the bank) would lead to reduced population sizes due to non-lethal mechanism (less breeding, poorer breeding condition).
