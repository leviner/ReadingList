## Significance:
The introduction to a special issue on behavior and fish conservation

## Notes:
The contribution of behavioral studies to conservation has been overlooked, particularly in aquatic sciences where there appears to remain a divide, particularly between the articles included in journals.  Meanwhile, public interest in conservation, largely driven by natural history television shows, is built on observations of behavior.  Also, without knowledge of behavioral interactions of how an animal interacts with others and its environment, we cannot fully reassemble failing ecosystems.

The papers in the issue are build around six themes:
- Reproductive behavior and its role in recovery
- species-habitat interactions and how habitat choice, loss, and protection impact success
- how reserves function
- the behavioral complexity of predator-prey interactions 
- Human behavior and our impacts
- Understanding and acting on conservation


The volume starts off with a call to arms (see Pister 1999 EBF), then four topics:
- Behavioral ecology and fish conservation focused on reproductive success, with papers looking at the implications of pollution, looking at the impact of toxins on behavior
- Fish behavior and the design of reef reserves, looking at the utility of reserves and how behavior is crucial to determine the proper size, timing, and utility of the reserves.  Papers look at interactions within the reserve and how they may influence success via reproduction and predator-prey relationships, and how migration and spawning timing in reef systems effects their exploitation.
- Behavior of imperiled fish, in which papers look at how interactions (introduced predators, reduced habitat) influence behavior and thus recovery/reproduction of a species.
- Human behavior and fish behavior, looking at how fishers take advantage of fish behavior to improve catch success, and looking at why behavior has been overlooked by researchers in conservation.
