Review discussing key fields and research where behavioral studies can assist conservation

## Notes:
There is a lack of animal behavior research being applied directly to conservation, though this work could be directed at applied problems.  Here, he lists conservation problems that could directly benefit from aimal behavioral work.

- Small population extinctions: There are some extinctions that are due to behavior, such as failure to successfully breed.  Examples are changes in communal display, behavior in pollinators in a  plant species, or changes in the behavior of a predator that leads to further decline.  In small populations in particular, sexual selection can play a key role, where behavioral components of choosing a mate leads to reproductive failure, or changes in the sexual structure of a population with environment which may be driven by nesting behavior or habitat selection.
- Mating systems: Inbreeding depression is related at its root to the mating system, and the possibility of altering the social system to effect the population size.
- Species isolation: In some species, hybridization is becoming a problem as is the loss of native species.  If two species hybridize, the consequences will depend on the mating behavior of each species.
- Dispersal in fragmented populations: How patches are left recolonized depends on the behavior of the animals and how they disperse to select patches.  This also has implications for the spread of disease.
- Predicting consequences of environmental change: understanding behavior will make it easier to predict how an animal will react within a novel environment.
- Reducing predation: introduction/removal depends on understanding the behavior of predators, and in some cases the solution may instead be to attempt to alter the behavior of the predator or prey as a nonlethal method (using deterrants, habitat modifications).
- Retaining cultural skills: success of release programs depends on knowing the necessary behavior/skills for an animal to posses, and understanding the impact of human interference on how an animal behaves in the wild is important.
- Behavioral manipulations: Alteration of migration routes, altering nests and other conservation schemes have been used.
- Release schemes: how and when to release animals may depend on the behavior of individuals/sexes or how they react to the environment they are released into.
- Habitat requirements: We need to gather more/better information on the habitat requirements of species under conservation concern, including utilization
- Minimum area necessary for reserves: Understanding range, behavior and dispersal is necessary to establish reserves that promote species success.
- Captive breeding: this often fails due to behavioral issues related to courting and choosing mates.
- Reproductive behavior/physiology: application of techniques on near-extinct populations in the wild
- Trade-offs in habitat preference: evaluate human disturbance through behavioral tradeoffs between resource and risk
- Measuring stress
- Census: understanding behavior is necessary for accurate surveys (likelihood of being counted/observed)
- Exploitation: similarly to census, how animals are "available" based on behavior and what that should mean for regulating exploitation.
- Human population increase: understanding the impacts of our own increasing population through behavioral components ma help address risk.
- Discounting: benefits now rather than later, which has important implications for conservation and exploitation.  How animals (including humans) value delayed reward is important for both those doing the conserving and those being conserved.
- Increasing conservation concern: how do we promote the valuation of conservation
- conserving behavior: in some instances, conserving a behavior itself is a necessary task.

Alternatively, it is important to understand the implications of environmental change on behavior, rather than the other way around, such as how species have changed their migration routes or altered their age at maturity based on environmentally-driven growth.
