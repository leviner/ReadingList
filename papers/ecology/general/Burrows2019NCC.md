## Significance:
Demonstrate the effect of temperature on community shifts independent of other pressures based on the thermal niches of species within marine communities.

## Notes:
Marine species are changing in distribution as a response to climate change. Local changes in species abundance and thermal affinity change the community structure. There is a need to be able to forecast this potential shift in community in marine environments.

Plankton and demersal surveys back to 1985 were used to describe regional changes in thermal affinity of the marine community. Community Thermal Index (CTI) describes the average thermal affinity of the group, STI of the individual species. Low thermal diversity reflects communities of similar STIs.

Areas less sensitive to warming will have a positive difference between CTI and local temperature (the community on average has a higher thermal affinity than what it currently is).

There are four scenarios for CTI ranges:
- High thermal diversity but narrow thermal ranges (lots of species with tight ranges covering a large band)
- High thermal diversity and wide thermal ranges (lots of species with very wide ranges covering a large band)
- Low thermal diversity with narrow thermal range (lots of species with tight ranges all in the same thermal band)
- Low thermal diversity with wide thermal ranges (lots of species with wide ranges but all in the same thermal band)

Spatial patterns in CTI broadly follow spatial patters in SST. Decreased CTI in plankton is expected based on the thermal range they experience. Areas with strong vertical temperature gradients had a negative thermal bias in the demersal species since temperatures are more stable at depth. This is also consistent with the redistribution of species to greater depths where thermal niches can exist without large horizontal migrations.
