## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Significance:
A manual of spatial indicators for use in fisheries ecology to describe population distribution.

## Notes:
All of the selected spatial statistics are independent of the inclusion or not of zero density values.

1. Centre of gravity - mean location of the surveyed population. It's sensitive to high density values.
2. Inertia - the variance of the location of the individuals in a population; how dispersed a population is around its center of gravity. Also sensitive to high values.
3. Isotropy/Anisotropy - Isotropic populations are evenly dispersed around its center, this Anisotropy measures the elongation of a distribution, without actually describing the true shape of the distribution which may not be elliptical.
4. Global index of collocation - a measurement to determine whether two populations are in the same geographic place but not in the same sample locations based on the location of their CGs, essentially the spatial overlap of two populations.
5. Number of spatial patches - patchiness, and the distribution of patches relative to the CG. Essentially this is a clustering algorithm. Patch locations can be used to measure the spatial stability of a popualtion over time.
6. Positive area - area occupied by fish.
7. Spreading area - a measure of the area occupied by a population which considers the variations in the density.
8. Equivalent area - the area that would be covered if there was equal density of individuals across the region.
9. Microstructure index - the fine scale variability in density, in terms of how irregular the density is at a small scale based on a some lag.
