## Significance:
Risk of predation is integral to decision making.  Here they outline many of the factors influenced by predation risk.

## Notes:
Though predation pressure may vary little over evolutionary time, it can vary significantly over short time scales, and since life is about more than just avoiding predation, animals must be capable of adjusting their behavior appropriately to the level of risk.

Probability of death is a function of   the rate of encounter, the probability of death given an encounter, and the time spent vulnerable to the attack.  Rate of encounter is a function of density and habitat.  Probability of death given an encounter includes many variables, such as escape ability, proximity to protection/cover, distance to predator, etc.  

Behavior of feeding animals
- When to feed: some times are more dangerous to eat than others, depending on predator activity and abiotic conditions such as light level.
- Deciding when to resume feeding after an attack: driven by the risk of predation and the stress of low food.
- Habitat selection: habitats vary in both profitability and predation risk (NCEs play a large part here, and change in behavior is driven by how hungry they are).  The greater the food quality, the riskier behavior they may demonstrate.  There could be non-food related trade offs, such as temperature.  Some animals simply prefer to feed close to cover, regardless of predator densities.
- Feeding Site selection: opportunity for escape is important, as is food density. Some foragers bring food to a safe location before consuming to reduce time at risk of predation.  "sit and wait" foragers may move between stations more or less often depending on predation.
- What to eat: though obvious that one would maximize rate of energy intake, some animals will instead prioritize less-profitable sources and safety.  Some animals may be more selective in high risk areas, maximizing the profit of their time exposed.
- Handling food: reducing handling time when exposed is important, and for example, birds in cover spend much more time breaking up their food than those exposed.

Decisions not related to feeding
- Sociality: predation controls selection
- Vigilance: With increasing group size, foragers become less vigilant.  Increasing group size leads to more eyes able to scan for predators, a given member can be less vigilant without the group vigilance decreasing.  
- Group size: group size increases with decreasing cover availability, and the decision to join a group/flock is dependent on risk.  Some animals will only seek to develop flocks when food is highly available, since this is a tradeoff between safety and food.  However, some animals may decrease group size, though their reasoning is unclear.  Fish in mixed species assemblages will separate under predation pressure of one of the species.
- Group structure: Fish will change the coordination of their swimming angles under predation risk (e.g., horizontal when low, differentiated angles for greater viewing range when high).  Other species may become more compact, reducing nearest neighbor distances.
- Location within the school/flock is advantageous, dominant players may force others to feed in less advantageous sites or positions most susceptible to predation.
- Post encounter: Animals reduce spontaneity and overall reduction in activity, this is done at a cost to feeding.  On the opposite end, they may increase activity as a continued escape response.
- Escaping: whether and when to escape given an encounter.  How soon it escapes may depend on how close the nearest cover is.  Also dependent on the probability that the predator has spotted the prey, the size and posture of the predator.
- Inspecting predators: Some prey approach/inspect the predator rather than immediately escaping.  Some species require close inspection to recognize the difference between predator and non-predator.  How much they inspect depends on the predator and its behavior (moving vs. stationary, etc.)
- Mobbing predators: Some animals in defense of young or food may mob attack Predators
- Respiration: some fish, when in low oxygen conditions may head to the surface to "gulp" air, increasing their exposure.  May also be more likely to be in greater oxygenated surface waters where predation risk is greater.  Some animals appear to synchronize breathing following an attack.

There is nothing constraining animals from choosing one extreme (feeding/predation), but there is likely some spectrum where maximizing of foraging and minimizing risk lie.  Future studies should consider predation risk as a determinant of behavior from the beginning.

There is also risk of reproduction to be considered.  Egg carrying, decreasing mobility and increasing size/visibility, need for increased foraging, all add to the cost of reproduction.  Strategies to alter reproductive effort such as synchronous breeding.

More work is needed in the field of modeling to increase the detail rather than a fixed mortality/predation term.
