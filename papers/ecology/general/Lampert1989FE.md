## Notes:
Many zooplankton perform DVM, typically evening ascent and morning descent.  Amplitude and shape of migration may differ by species and by age/stage, and be influenced by external conditions (turbidity, food).

What we don't consider is the behavior and variability among individuals within the population migrating.  We only observe the net effect.

DVM must have some adaptive value since everyone does it.  Serveral costs of migrating:
- reduced food, thus slower growth
- developmental time of eggs is extended
- swimming requires energy

Competing Hypotheses:
- Metabolic or demographic advantage
- avoidance of light-dependent mortality risk

Metabolic and demographic advantage
- resting in cold slow metabolic conditions during the day but still feeding in warm productive regions
- copepods growing at cold temperatures may grow larger, resulting in a demographic advantage, though this has not been shown for those which grow in fluctuating temperatures
- vertical migration appears to be energy disadvantageous

*Energy conservation*
- energy loss due to starvation in warm water would be greater than in cold, so migration may derive from the need to find food, migrating animals would receive a net gain, assuming feeding rate increases with temperature

*Resource related Hypotheses*
- algal biomass might be greater in the evening because growth during day, loses at night, and animals returning to the surface will feed at enhanced rates, with higher quality and abundance of food.
- This depends on the animals feeding ability to adapt to changes in food concentration quickly.
- Has been proposed to be a mechanism to reduce overexploitation. Harvesting at night and leaving algae to grow during the day results in a greater crop.

Light related mortality
- fitness is gained by reduced mortality instead of increased fecundity.  Zooplankton have no shelter, so their only refuge is darkness
- You would predict:
  - zooplankton must go up at dusk and back down at dawn
  - larger animals (those more susceptible to being eaten by fish) would be the common ones to migrate
  - amplitude of migration changes as a function of predation.  Seasonal patterns have in fact been observed as result of seasonal fish presence.
- Visual predators are very effective at limiting fitness since they seek out larger and brooding animals

Tradeoffs
- There must be a tradeoff between maximum energy input and maximum protection, and thus migration is likely a compromise
**In the presence of predation pressure, food availability and temperature gradients should determine migration patterns**

No migration if the costs of staying deep are low, food availability is high and thermal gradient is not steep.  With increasingly bad conditions at depth, a higher ascent occurs.  In low food conditions, energy balance may not be maintained by only feeding for some period of time, thus they must take the rise of being at the surface and being eaten.

Conclusions
- Is there a unifying theory across all taxa?
