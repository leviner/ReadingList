Brief letter on the history of behavioral ecology as a field

## Notes:
Behavioral ecologists look to determine why behavior is adaptive through the interaction of behavior, ecology, and genetics.  How does fitness vary as a function of behavior?  Behavior includes:
- mechanisms
- reproductive strategies
- survival strategies
- social behavior
- life history strategy
- population interaction

History: In the 1980s, there was rapid growth in research on reproduction, survival, and social interactions, leading to the formation of a recognized research society recognizing it as a distinct discipline.

In 1994, over 20% of behavioral ecology papers are focused on sexual selection, increasing in popularity as foraging theory decreased.

Where is the field going?  Introduction of -omics and dna fingerprinting will help, and individual based models will further become robust thanks to behavioral ecology, moving from a descriptive to predictive field.  There is also a future in the incorporation of human and animal behavioral theory and application.
