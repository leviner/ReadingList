## Notes:
Anyone who understands the dangers we are putting on the planet and its biota should take some responsibility and act to conserve it.  Recognition of a problem is now global but we need to define a structured solution, and researchers/managers are responsible.

Our values must reflect the broader picture rather than the short-term value seen by individuals and stakeholders.

Broadening research direction and professional responsibility: universities currently do not incentivize or provide means to support the activities specified within the university mission, particularly when regarding engagement.  Encouraging conservation application in addition to basic science is important (consider how your research has made a contribution to solving environmental problems).

Enhanced communication: communication between agency and academic science needs to improve to build better cohesive and designed conservation and management programs.  He proposes the question we should be asking ourselves: "Is my research realistically going to help assure the creature or habitat (or ecosystem) I am studying will exist in the year 2048, or 2098?"

Roots of the problem: There is a disconnect in how we are taught as scientists to address questions in boxes, which is aggravated by increasing specialty, rather than integrative and interdisciplinary thinking.  University curricula has moved away from these broad philosophical contexts and thus the ethics and values of the science are no longer taught.

Our best hope comes from environmental philosophers who can convince an electorate of the value and moral obligation of preserving nature.
