## Significance:
Prey put in a significant amount of effort to avoid predation, and this behavior has major implications at the individual, population, and ecosystem level.  A review of the current research.

## Notes:
Tradeoffs
- The same behaviors that make an animal a successful forager increases its risk of being eaten, thus natural selection should lead to animals that manage the tradeoffs of eating and being eaten.
- One of the best ways to test for this experimentally is to starve animals to show that deprived animals are prone to more risk.
- Tradeoffs are seen in use of space, choosing the most profitable locations when risk is high.
- Activity levels, decreasing movement when risk is high

Consequences for individuals
- Anti-predator decision making: demonstrating that increasing anti-predator behavior decreases risk is difficult.  Less alert animals are more likely to be eaten.
- Costs of anti-predator decision making: lower energy intake, slower growth and development, smaller adults, eggs, and lower fecundity, this lower fitness as an individual and species.

Population level Consequences
- Local effects: prey immigration into stream pools can often overwhelm the predators ability to keep them in check, however emigration from the same pools shows a different effect.  predator-induced emigration could be a greater impact than direct consumption.
- Different types of predators can have different non-lethal impacts depending on their own ecology.
- In terrestrial animals, absence in particular habitats are signs of predation avoidance.
- Microhabitat (small scale) impacts are not always useful, though the physical structure (e.g., cover, protective vegetation) can have a large influence.  These small-scale relationships may not be the most telling about population-level impacts.  A good remaining questions is how do these observations translate?
- Whole populations: (whole-lake manipulations).  Resource competition on these scales, driven by predator avoidance, can lead to reproduction and multi-generational population level impacts.
- Predator-prey population cycling: oscillations of population size driven by large population changes and increased exploitation, though habitat use and other no lethal impacts lead to variability in these curves.  As the population of hares declined, non-lethal effects limited the fitness of those that remained, further driving the collapse of the population.


Few predator-prey models consider anti-predator decision making, and when included has been shown to stabilize oscillatory cycles.

Non-lethality can indirectly influence ecosystems
- Competitive outcomes: differential habitat selection under risk of predation prevents competitive exclusion between species.  Or the other way, where with no predator, they are evenly matched, but under predation, behavior of one species leads to its demise.  And if all is even, there may be competition for refuge space.
- Top down: many effects are behavioral, due to avoidance of areas with predators, increasing bottom (e.g., algal growth).
