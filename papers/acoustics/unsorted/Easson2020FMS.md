## Significance:
Used eDNA sampling paired with shipboard and lowered echosounders systems to identify organism groups in DVM cycles, tracking taxa movement through the water column with both methods.

## Notes:
Acoustics can be used to observe the dynamics of DVM, but are limited in their ability to classify specific compositoin of the migrating layers. Net sampling may undersample the environment and the variety of organisms migrating (e.g., difficult to capture gelatinous organisms). Here, they use eDNA during DVM to asses the ability of using environmental genetics to capture dynamics of migration and the composition of acoustically detected SSLs.

Acoustic data was collected from a pole-mounted shipboard system (18, 38, 70, and 120) and a WBAT was mounted on the CTD with 70 and 120 kHz transducers. Data were filtered and integrated into epi- upper meso- and lower mesopelagic layers.  WBAT data was used to identify targets and tracked. Seawater collections were made according to the position of the CTD relative to the scattering layer which was fixed at 320 m during early migration and at 125 m after. DNA extractions were conducted following the cruise and sequenced, and classified according to the Silva database. Amplicon sequences were used to construct relative abundances within a sample, and diversity metrics were calculated.

There were >10000 unique ASVs found in the eDNA samples, though <100 were included for analysis as most represented unicellular or unidentified eukaryotic organisms.

During ascending and descending DVM, different groups exhibited peak relative abundances in the eDNA sampling: copepods were most abundandant in the earlier samples while tunicates, ctenopheres, and cnidarians all appeared in later samples. Teleost fish which are assumed to make up the highest proportion of acoustic scattering were present throughout. There were also taxa-specific differences in timing identified based on single ASVs.

The result of this eDNA sampling is a complex community of invertebrates. There are many resident pelagic fauna, as will as varibility in migrating groups. The major issue with the sampling in this study was the short 18srNA resulted in low identification (~31%) which may also be a function of poor annotation in the available database. They attribute the lack of larger crustaceans and the low relative abundance of teleosts to: 1) low concentrations of eDNA from those organisms, 2) lack of taxonomic database resolution, 3) siphonophores were more abundant than fishes, or 4) issues with sequencing.

They do observe a two-phase migration in their acoustics, and the eDNA indicate the early migration of calanoid copepods, thus potentially indicating evidence of predation avoidance.
