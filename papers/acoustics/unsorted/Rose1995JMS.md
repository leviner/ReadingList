## Title:
Cod (Gadus morhua L.) migration speeds and transport relative to currents on the north-east Newfoundland Shelf
## Keywords:
cod, swim speed, migration, school
## Geographic Coverage
Newfoundland Shelf
## Field Dates:
06/18/1990 - 07/15/1992
## Significance:
Observations of cod migration from spawning to feeding grounds over 3 years using acoustic detection of shoal centroid.  Observations indicate fish use active behavior to remain within the migration route.

## Notes:
Conditions for optimal feeding, growth, and reproduction rarely coincide, hence migration.  Sedentary population usually contain fewer individuals and are less productive.

Fish develop specialized migratory behaviors in order to exploit their environment, which influence the spatial patterns of the population.  Swim speed is necessary to address migration, which requires both fish movement and ambient current measurements.

Atlantic cod historically spawn in the northeast shelf in late winter and migrate towards inshore feeding grounds in the summer.  Migration typically occurs via warm water in the deeper basins where Atlantic water underlies the Labrador current.  After spawning, cod initially move south with the currents.  However once in the deep basin, the currents are more variable and can head offshore.  They hypothesize that:
- Cod would passively drift during portions of the migration
- Cod would use an active form of swimming behavior with advancing currents and stay near bottom during opposing flows
- Cod migrate against opposing flows

Cod were tracked to determine daily ground and swim speeds, distance traveled, heading along route.  Dual beam 38 kHz was used to track large schools by criss-crossing the aggregation continuously in order to define the cnter and edges, and trawls were used to validate species.  Currents were measured with a grid of current meters.  Swimming speed was determined via the daily movements of the centroid of the aggregation, and thus likely underestimates individual swim speeds.

Results
- Movements occured sporadically rather than regularly.
- Mean track headings were consistent across years
- Cod typically remained near bottom when less mobile, and would move off-bottom when migrating, independent of DVM.

Migration rates are typically slow but highly variable.  The largest displacement rates occurred when cod encountered capelin prey.  Under high food availability, energy-saving strategies are less necessary.

Swimming speeds were well below laboratory maximum observed speeds. Cod foraging movements are sporadic and that prey search occurs at slow speeds, matching the submarine searching theory that slow speeds maximize efficiency .

Cod appear to move shoeward with the advancing warm-water currents, indicating that the migration route is at least partially determined by thermal conditions.

During migration, cod moved upward in the water column, possibly increasing buoyancy and reducing energy expense.  Major shoreward movements corresponded with shoreward currents, and much of the time cod tended to drift along the migration route at slow speeds.

Very little passive movement was observed, particularly since there is strong cross-track currents, and cod tended to remain near bottom rather then retreat with currents back offshore, supporting the active transport hypothesis.  Foraging behavior is likely a major influence on movement patterns.  Cod appear to have attempted to hold ground against strong current rather than advance against them.

Interannual migrations of cod are consistent, with nearly identical headings over 3 years, believed to be established by "thermal highways" and bathymetry which are stable and consistent from year to year.  Migration patterns are likely learned, and younger fish within the shoal follow older fish.
