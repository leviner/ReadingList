## Significance:
ICES EK80 workshop report with guidance on the implementation of EK80 systems in fisheries surveys.

# Notes:
Inherent differences between EK80 and EK60:
- EK80 has a wider nandwidth receiver filter even for CW data
- Output of EK80 is complex waveform, while EK60 is power and phase
- EK80 data is at a higher decimated sampling rate

EK80 licences are bounded by frequency range to operate specific transducers. for transducer models, the frequency range, decimation, and sampling rates vary.

The workshop conducted a series of experiments to compare the EK80 to EK60 both in CW and FM mode, and found that they could produce similar estimates of sA required for conducting surveys.
