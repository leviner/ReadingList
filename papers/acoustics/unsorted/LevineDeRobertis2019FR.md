## Significance:
Demonstration of systematic subsampling to produce similar survey means with reduced user effort.

## Notes:
Post-processing scrutinization of acoustic surveys, while necessary, is time consuming.

Fish distribution is spatially autocorrelated as fish tend to form continuous schools and because environmental conditions are spatially correlated. The precision of systematic sampling (i.e. transect lines) improves because of this spatial autocorrelation. Here, they test that the estimates of backscatter form analyses of a smaller percentage of backscatter can accurately characterize the mean value of the whole track by:
1. Analyzing and comparing subsampled estimates of sA to the entire survey area
2. Apply this subsampling to a historic dataset to identify potential regions for future survey extension

The survey was divided into different sized segments: 15 nmi, 180 nmi, 750 mi, and 5000-nmi. Within each segment, subsamples of 50-ping segments were chosen, representing a 309m section of trackline for each segment. 1-100% of these segments were included, and percent error was calculated as a function of the % of included segments.

Precision of subsampling was dependent on sub-area length. At larger sub-area sizes, low error could be accomplished at on 5-10% subsampling. High errors were typically subsamples with low backscatter. As the length of a subsection of trackline increased, so does the number of 50 ping bins so the sample overall is larger. With increasing sample numbers, the mean will converge towards the mean of the total. For smaller trackline sections, the number f subsamples is too low to be reliable.
