## Title:
Persistent Sampling of Vertically Migrating Biological Layers by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle within the Beam of a Seabed-Mounted Echosounder
## Keywords:
autonomous, glider, acoustics, eDNA, AUV
## Geographic Coverage
Moneterey Bay, CA, USA
## Field Dates:
05/29/19 - 06/06/19
## Significance:
Use of AUVs to collect eDNA samples within the beam of a seafloor mounted echosounder

## Notes:
The paper describes the field testing and sensor alignment of a multi-AUV system to validate acoustic scatterers. During long term deployments of remote acoustic systems, it is difficult to obtain direct samples. They used two long range AUV's equipped with ESPs to collect eDNA. Water is pumped through a cartridge, and filters are treated with a reagent to preserve the genetic material. A surface tracking vehicle (wave glider) kept track of environmental conditions and maintained the position over the seafloor echosounder while the auv operated at depth. Positioning was communicated via acoustic transponder. eDNA samples were acquired in hourly intervals from ~50 m depth bins.
