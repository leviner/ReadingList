## Title:
Acoustic deployments reveal Antarctic silverfish under ice in the Ross Sea
## Keywords:
sea ice, forage fish, moorings, acoustics
## Geographic Coverage
Ross Sea
## Field Dates:
02/21/2015 - 02/05/2016
## Significance:
This is a proof of concept study using a moored echosounder (ASL AZFP) and discrete observations from ships (acoustic and optical) to determine the abundance and spawning grounds of Antarctic silverfish.

## Notes:
Antarctic silverfish are a keystone species in the Ross Sea, with a circumpolar distribution in Antarctic waters.  They spawn under sea ice on the shelves in late winter/early spring, and post-larval fish are distributed throughout the water column.  Transition to juveniles around 2-3 years, and are largely pelagic throughout their adult life, reaching maturity at ~6-7 years.   They're found in the greatest concentrations along the continental slope.

It's not known whether the eggs are spawned in Terra Nova Bay or if there is a migration of spawning fish in winter.  

An upward facing ASL AZFP at 67 kHz was deployed at 380m in 550m water, collected data from 15 May to 1 December 2015, pinging every 15s.  An ADCP and CTD package were mounted just below the AZFP.  Acoustic data were also collected through the ice via a pole-lowered system on 6 occasions during November of 2015 and 2017, and baited underwater camera systems were used for target identification.  Sv estimates were converted to abundance using model estimates of silverfish.  The systems were not calibrated at depth, though relative abundance can still be determined.

Ice thickness was estimated based on surface ranges in open water and ice covered periods.  Considerable "sea ice noise" was observed in the acoustics, attributed to fracture and subduction of ice rather than biological processes, though it is possible that these could originate from extremely dense aggregations of organisms or biologically produced bubbles.

Weak single targets were detected near the transducer, while large diving targets, possibly marine mammals, were observed near the surface.  SIlverfish-like targets were observed in September in aggregations between 230 and 380 meters.  In December, prior to the end of deployment, weak silverfish-like targets were observed in the upper 100m of the water column.

During the ship-based deployments, silverfish were observed in a layer from ~500m to the seabed, however limited acoustic data was recorded in 2015.  IN 2017, juvenile silverfish were observed within 100m of the seabed. during two deployments.  No adult aggregations of silverfish were observed during ship-based observations.

The moored echosounder may not have been deep enough (170m off bottom) to observe the depth distribution of silverfish.  The observations of adults in september may indicate a later spawning time or fish entering the area post-spawning.

Mean densities were very low, indication loose aggregations rather than schooling behavior.

Adult and juvenile silverfish exhibit different scattering properties, and thus a further need for improved in situ TS measurements remains.  Observations using the underwater video confirm that juveniles have very low density difference, and at the densities observed by the camera would have had much higher scattering if TS was assumed similar to adults.

The mooring data was able to provide insight into the physical properties of the ice (draft, breaking).
