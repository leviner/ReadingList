## Title:
Advances in Ecosystem Research: Saildrone Surveys of Oceanography, Fish, and Marine Mammals in the Bering Sea
## Keywords:
autonomous, saildrone, acoustics, prey distribution
## Geographic Coverage
Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
05/01/16 - 10/01/16
## Significance:
Overview of the 2016 Saildrone mission in the Bering Sea investigating relationships between fur seal bheavior and pollock distribution

## Notes:
This was the first study by NOAA using the saildrone's following Chris Meinig's work demonstrating the integration.  105 days out of Dutch Harbor, used the 70 kHz WBAT and an acousonde hydrophone.  Simultaneous with saildrone operations, fur seals were tagged.  The saildrones followed the tagged seals and were able to monitor the dive behavior of the seals while mapping the pollock distribution in the water column.

This survey was the foundation of De Robertis et al, 2019 which describes the co-calibration of the saildrones and the NOAAS Oscar Dyson in the Bering Sea.  The paper also describes much of the sensor integration ad plans for future deployments.
