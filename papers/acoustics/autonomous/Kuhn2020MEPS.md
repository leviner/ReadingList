## Title:
Test of unmanned surface vehicles to conduct remote focal follow studies of a marine predator
## Keywords:
autonomous, acoustics, pollock, predator
## Geographic Coverage
Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
07/01/16 - 10/01/17
## Significance:
Showed the feasibility of using saildrones to conduct focal follow surveys of northern fur seals and characterize their habitat use.

## Notes:
Focal follow studies provide detailed information about predator-prey relationships and marine predator habitat utilization. Unmanned vehicles expand the capability by expanding coverage and deployment time.

46 female seals were tagged over two summers, and individuals were followed for ~2 days to survey the habitat and record oceanographic information.  

A total of 6 follows were conducted, with mean separation distances of only ~.6 km, and an average time separation of 2-5 hours. They present example oceanographic and acoustic data, which indicate that the density and depth distribution of pollock influenced seal behavior in terms of diving, however they do not account for the time offset and possible migration of these fish populations.

Saildrones, while feasible for focal follow surveys, have a larger time delay than traditional methods. This could be improved via improvement of tag reporting (increasing GPS frequency of tracking) or the use of acoustic tags to keep the Saildrone nearby.
