## Keywords:

## Significance:
Calibrated a bottom-mounted observatory echosounder using a sphere from a ship in dynamic positioning.

## Notes:
Short manuscript describing the process of calibrating the 70 kHz FM system at the LoVe observatory (mounted at ~250m depth) off of northern Norway. Calibration was done from the GO Sars, with the sphere deployed to ~180m range from the seafloor mounted transducer.

They used a large (57.2) WC sphere to avoid false detections of fish (this is the IMR "all frequencies" cal sphere) and had the ship move using DP within a 28 x 28m grid. At the far range for the transducer, this resulted inc overage on all quadrants. Final calibration at that range resulted in an RMS of ~0.2.
