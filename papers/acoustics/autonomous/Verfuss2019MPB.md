## Title:

## Significance:
A review of passive and active acoustic integration into unmanned vehicles, aimed at marine animal monitoring.

## Notes:
There are 3 types of industry monitoring: (1) population monitoring to look at abundance/density, (2) mitigation to trigger mitigation actions when animals are nearby/impacted, and (3) focal monitoring to specifically identify responses to sound. Unmanned systems can augment and support these monitoring studies. Here, they present the factors that should be considered when planning marine surveys addressing one of these three objectives using unmanned vehicles/

This paper includes:
- An overview of the 3 monitoring types, including the data goals and requirements for each
- An overview of the platform types:
  - aerial (powered aircraft, kites, balloons)
  - underwater (propeller driven, buoyancy gliders, powered/self-powered surface vehicles, drifting sensors)
- Data relay systems
- Sensor types
  - Optical sensors (RGB/Thermal/IR cameras)
  - Passive acoustic systems
  - Active acoustic systems
  - Animal transponders/tags
- Suitability of different platform and sensor combinations for certain objectives and animals in order to accomplish Mitigation, Population, or Focal-animal monitoring. Examples are given based on the species/behavior objective and monitoring conditions including the spatial/temporal coverage, weather considerations, and special needs such as station keeping or detection probability.

They conclude with a comparison of systems and review of considerations when choosing a platform and instrument integration. They recommend the use of simulation to identify needs and expected behavior/movement/cues with various sensors.
