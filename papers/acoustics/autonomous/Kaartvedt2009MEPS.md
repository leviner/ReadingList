## Title:
Use of bottom-mounted echo sounders in exploring behavior of mesopelagic fishes
## Keywords:
swimming behavior, target tracking, migration, mooring
## Geographic Coverage
Masfjorden, Norway
## Field Dates:
07/22/2007 - 11/06/2007
## Significance:
Reporting of observations from 3 months of a 15-month deployment of a moored upward facing EK60 in a fjord, with brief discussions of the behavior of lanternfish. Behaviors were derived from tracked fish, using population movement as the "current" to be removed from individual tracks.

## Notes:
To collect data of detailed behavior of small mesopelagic fish and their predators in situ, a bottom-mounted upward facing echosounder was cabled in a fjord for 15 months.  The system was a 38 kHz EK60 in pressure housing, deployed to 390m depth, cabled for both power and data transfer.  Data were collected at 1Hz and .512 ms.

Tracking data presented are from both an automated approach (Balk & Lindem, 2002, Sonar5Pro) and selection of individuals by human operator.  Fish were divided into two classes: large (TS > -52) and small (-62 < TS < -52) and tracked separately with different requiremets for pings missed and how many sequential hits.  Errors in swim speed do to inaccuracies or errors in the beam position can be corrected using smoothing (Handegaard 2005 and Rostad 2006).  

Observations:
- Strong scattering layer at 150-200m during the day and carrying out DVM in July and August, but less so in November observations.
- Focusing on lanternfish:
  - In july, took normal DVM, however some of the population remained at depth.
  - In august, the DVM pattern changed, with the shallower fish continuing and the lower layer having a more restricted migration.
  - In november, about 50% of the population was no longer migrating
- Behavior:
  - maximum vertical speeds of ~2mm/s, remaining within the beam for long periods ascribed to low acitivity.
  - Currents were strongest in August and november, resulting in a 6 hour cycle of horizontal movement
  - Subtracting these population net horizontal movements (currents) from the individual track displacement results in slow moving individual tracks
  - Overall their behavior was plannktonic, resembling the currents, even in weak flow.
  - General movement was 3-5cm/s (.5 BL s-1), with maximum velocities ~8cm/s
  - records of non-migrating fish at depth, not as a result of a synchronous migrations.  These fish were likely in a digesting/post-digesting state while those migrating were actively feeding.
  - Intermittent small shifts in their movement may be due to predators.

Potential predatory fish were located in deep water, with swim speeds of ~ 1/3 BL s-1 based on acoustic determination of size.

To understand ecosystem functioning, it is important to observe over long periods.  Submerged echosounders enables the study of cm-sized organisms in undisturbed habitat at long time scales.
