## Notes:
Autonomous vehicles with echosounders are becoming more widely available. The main limitation of these vehicles is their inability to directly sample biology, however there are some regions where species diversity is low and backscatter directly correlates to biomass. In the Bering, pollock dominate the acoustic backscatter.

Many fisheries surveys had to be cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19, so in order to maintain the time series, saildrone USVs were used to conduct a survey. The key challenges in these surveys is the lack of biological sampling, the timeline, and generating results comparable with biological surveys.

Methods:
- Three saildrones were deployed from Alameda, equipped with EK80-minis. Conducted 14 transect survey of the EBS spaced 74 km apart (double the typical AT survey spacing). Data was only recorded to 300 m.
-  Water column was analyzed in two layers, 16m from surface to 3m from bottom and 3m from bottom 0.5 m from bottom. To account for the difference in the ADZ between the 38-7 on the Dyson and the 38-18 on the saildrone, the difference between the backscatter estimated in the ADZ from the USV and the RV was added to the USV observation.
- To convert the backscatter to biomass, Total Biomass(B) = Pollock backscatter (A) * conversion estimate (C), using previous surveys as a whole. A LOO was done to see how well the other years would predict each survey's biomass.
- A 1-D CV was calculated to determine the error as a result of the transect spacing
- Monte Carlo simulation was run to predict B where A was randomly drawn from A * a value from the distribution of the CV and C was randomly drawn from +/- 1 SD.

Results
- 45% of the backscatter was assigned to pollock
- Pollock backscatter in previous surveys exhibited a similar trend as pollock biomass, and a linear regression indicates that biomass is well correlated backscatter.
- The LOO indicates that biomass could be estimated without the trawl information for the given year
- Previous surveys indicate that trends/biomass are reasonably similar if even vs. odd transects are used rather than the complete spatial coverage.
- Total biomass was higher than the last survey in 2018, with pollock most abundant in the nothwest portion of the survey area. The CV of the biomass was 2.3 times that of the rest of the time series.

Discussion
- It is important to acknowledge and address changes in survey methodology when continuing a time series
- The primary limitation in using USVs for fishery management is the lack of biological data
- The AT survey is key for age 2-4 pollock (midwater associated ages) and assessing pre-recruit abundance for the assessment
- This survey was the only source of fishery-independent data for stock assessment, and it was importnat to ensure that appropriate uncertainty was included in order to count as a continuation of the time series
- The biomass conversion here is the equivalent of applying the average mass-specific target strengths observed in previous surveys to the USV observations. The direct backscatter to biomass conversion assumes the average length-frequency of previous surveys. The correlation between the two indicates that interannual changes in size and species do not contribute to significant interannual variation.
- Key differences between USVs and ships: fish reactions are different, shallower instrumentation, lighter payloads (and thus compact transducers)
- These methods work only in a well-characterised environment, and trawl estimates of size and species composiition are still critical for fisheries management.
- Hybrid ship/USV approaches, the inclusion of fishery-dependent data (corrected for gear), and simulation/reanalysis of existing data can be used to improve USV applications and quantify their effectiveness.
