## Significance:
Observations of depth-variable TS and spectral classification in mesopelagic layers which indicate ship-based 38 kHz estimates may be underestimating biomass.

## Notes:
Estimates of abundance are sensitive to resonance, as target strength varies significantly around the peak. Shipboard echosounders cannot resolve targets in the mesopelagic, and many of these targets have resonances lower than typical fisheries echosounder systems. Broadband echosounders at depth can help to constrain abundance by resolving target strengths and, based on frequency response, better resolve size and composition.

Deep-See was deployed with 7 broadband transducers, 4 (45-420 kHz)  using an EK80 and 3 using a customized Edgetech transceiver (1-45 kHz). The data analysis was focused on the 30 and 70 kHz nominal frequency bands. Individual targets were manually selected.

Target strength distributions varied as a function of depth, and are cosnsistent with the shipboard observations.
- Layer 1: Mix of mesopelagic and epipelagic species showing slat, resonant, and near-resonant TS in the 30 kHz band
- Layer 2: Majority of the targets were resonant, with peaks between 33 and 35 kHz
- Layer 3: Large number of targets below resonance, with complex forms in the 70 kHz band
- Layer 4: Many targets near resonance in the 70 kHz band
- Layer 5: Mix of all spectral classifications, many resembling gas-bearing organisms

Based on these target strengths, shipboard echosounders may considerably underestimate mesopelagic biomass (studies of open ocean have used TS of ~10 dB weaker than what was observed here), particularly due to low TS at 38 kHz as resonance can be far outside of that band.

Mesopelagic scatterers are complex as a function of depth and spectral classifications indicate that the stability of presumed values at 38 kHz used in ship-based assessments may not be accurate.
