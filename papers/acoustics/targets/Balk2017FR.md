## Significance:
Simulations and field observations of TS and angle biases due to surface reflection in horizontal acoustics and target tracking.  

## Notes:
During horizontal surveys, transducers are typically mounted within 1 meter of the surface.  The surface layer has issues, due to beam directed at the surface, strong temperature gradients, and multipath reflections.

The effectiveness of these surveys rely on an assumption of weak side beams.  Here, they investigate that assumption, and the impact of surface reflections on target strength and split-beam locations.

A transducer and fixed-calibration targets were mounted in a reservoir, using an EK60 running a 120-10x4 transducer.  A similar arrangement was modeled in 2D space to simulate the surface, including the beam pattern of the transducer.  Simulated beam pattern closely matches that measured.

Both simulations and observations show a range dependent impact of smooth sea surface on targets.  A target, moving away from the transducer, passes through three zones:
- Near-transducer: correct and non-oscillating TS and range/position.  One might expect a strong direct reflection and very weak surface reflected return.
- Oscillation zone: small, high-frequency oscillations, with amplitude increasing and frequency decreasing as a target moves away.  This is dependent on the range of both the target and transducer away from the surface.
- Relaxation zone: TS and angles are influenced by surface reflection but do not oscillate. TS decreases with range

The position also oscillates with range, further driving inaccurate TS estimation due to incorrect beam compensation from oscilating split-beam position.

A smooth surface can clearly introduce errors, and theoretically assumed "zones" were observed in in situ data, with significant (+/- 10db) errors in TS.  In surface waters, temperature gradients can also lead to refraction, bending the beam down in the water column and shifting the range of the target. Mirror reflections can be more serious noise concerns than a lightly wavy/disrupted surface.

The first zone can be maximized by using a shorter pulse length and deeper transducer mounting, though target depth will still be a noise concern.  Guidelines established in various sea state conditions are necessary, based on further modeling and experimental observations.
