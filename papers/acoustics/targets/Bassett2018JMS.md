## Keywords:
broadband, wideband, species discrimination, echosounder
## Geographic Coverage
Gulf of Alaska
## Field Dates:
06/10/2015 - 08/08/2015
## Significance:
Demonstrate the variability in Sv spectra among different monospecific aggregations in the Gulf of Alaska and the limited ability to discriminate among species.

## Notes:
Species discrimination from acoustic data is difficult among similar species or in determining age classes. Broadband systems provide more information than narrowband in the form of a continuous frequency dependent backscatter measurement. There are now commercial systems (EK80) that can collect this data, and the potential for improved target classification has not been investigated. Surveys continue to use narrowband systems to discriminate among species in support of trawl decisions, much of which is based on modeled backscatter of species. Here, they use a commercial broadband system to characterize the broadband response of organisms during a pollock survey in comparison with narrowband response.

Collected data using 18, 38, 70 , and 120kHz transducers covering 15-150kHz bandwidth for analysis.

Included in the methods are detailed descriptions of the broadband calibrations.

Measurements were collected throughout the survey (supplemental to narrowband), and Aleutian Wing Trawl samples outfitted with a stereo camera system was used to determine species stratification and composition. Broadband data was collected over aggregations dominated by single species or taxon. Data was collected (multiplexed) on both narrowband (GPT) and broadband (WBT) systems using the same transducers. Well-defined aggregations were manually identified and used to construct independent Sv. Fish length frequencies were identified from trawls.

Ping-to-ping Sv was highly variable, driven by motion, orientation, and density changes, with deviations of up to 20 dB between pings. Averaging into distributions of Sv reduced this variability to 5dB within single frequency bins, and <2.5 dB across multiple bins.

Monospecific aggregations of different species have similar structures. There are some cases where broadband can be used to provide additional information such as where there are high peaks. The added bandwidth confirms the slope, indicating a peak resonance potentially outside of the narrowband range.

Broadband provides improved range resolution, but despite the bandwidth, expectations should be tempered with regard to improving species discrimination. Species that are similar within narrowband ranges are likely to be similar in broadband. The advantages are dependent on the ecosystem and species, and may be advantageous for some combinations rather than others. Differences in Sv spectra within species can be greater than the expected differences among species due to the variability in field measurements. This can be seen in in situ measurements of pollock and POP observed here. At the same time, variations in target strength or volume backscatter as a function of frequency that are attributed to morphological differences between fishes lacking swimbladders can be identified. It is also possible to better constrain the size of animals in zooplankton aggregations and species with spectral resonance within the range of the band.

Further development at lower frequencies (< 10 kHz) will help with species discrimination based on swimbladder resonance.
