## Significance:
Comparision of organism density estimates derived from volume backscatter and echo-counting methods.

## Notes:
Data:
- Measurements were collected at depth using towed system Deep-See and 18-45 kHz transducer.
- Ship-based Sv measurements were collected using an EK60 (18, 38, 120, 200 kHz)
- From Deep-See, they determined single targets and equivalent target strength at 38 kHz
  - match filtering
  - split-beam processing
  - Target detection (following Echoview) with a thresholding by bin (20 second x 2-m bins) where the median (Ts?Sv?) did not exceed -85 (this was determined empiracally from the data)
  - Calculate the linear average from 37 - 39 kHz, and multiple hits of the same target were averaged and recorded as a function of depth.
- Organism desnity
  - Echo-counting: number of targets as a function of volume
  - Volume backscattering: Sv/sigma bs of the mean TS38 for all targets
  - Volume backscattering with depth dependent TS

Mean water column TS did not vary significantly, but TS as a function of depth changed across sampling sites were there were distinct scattering layers. In layers of high target densities, the estimates from shipboard volume backscatter exceeded the estimates from echo-counting by up to a factor of 6. In zones where TS as a function of depth did not vary significantly, the estimates of organism density are in better agreement.

The use of representative target strengths provide relatively accurate measurements of mesopelagic densities. While echo-counting is likely the most accurate method, it fails in high density regions and is not possible at the scale of acoustic surveys. Applying depth-dependent TS estimates to shipboard data does improve volume backscattering estimates and provide context for changes in species distributions.
