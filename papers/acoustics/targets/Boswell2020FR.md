## Significance:
Used CT scan swimbladder models to look at variability in common reef fish species in the Gulf of Mexico. Variability was high, and they report new TS-L relationships for their taxa.

## Notes:
Fisheries assessments for exploited reef fish rely on fishery-dependent data as well as additional independent estimates, though much of those methods are extraction-based. Less invasive methods exist such as optics and acoustics, though in high-diversity areas such as dense reefs, acoustic methods are difficult as many species can have similar frequency-dependent patterns and their proximity to structure (i.e., reefs) can make it impossible to detect targets near surfaces.

Broadband acoustics exhibit potential for more species-specific backscatter signature identification. The variation in morphology and swimbladder structure may make it possible to identify variations between species.

Here they use modeled species-specific spectra to look at feasibility of broadband in the identification of species of species groups of reef fish in the Gulf of Mexico.

Swimbladder and morphology data
- Fish were collected via hook-and-line in Alabama and anesthetized
- 149 individuals within 9 species were CT scanned
- A PCA was done on the morphometrics of the swim bladders to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Acoustic modeling
- Wiremesh models were made at various resolutions representing 30-50k, 52-100, 102-150, and 152-200 kHz bands.
- TS was calculated for each CT scan model from 30-200 kHz over -45 to 45 degree tils.
- TS to length relationships were modeled, and a length-normalized TS was computed for all of the swim bladders scans

Results
- morphology
  - large variation in multivariate space in 2 dimensions driven by height/thickness, and angle of Swimbladder
- TS model
  -  Wide variation across species
  - peak scattering between -10 and -30 degree tilt which approximates the angle where the swimbladder would be horizontal
  - In the length-normalized TS responses, about 1/2 were indistinguishable, while some species had much more complex frequency responses
  - The TS-TL relationships are generally linear as expected and for some species are the first recorded.

Though the swimbladder is the most significant contributor to backscatter, the significant differences in morphology among species is probably the main contributor to the variability in the models. In some cases, such as in gray triggerfish which have a round swimbladder with a steeper angle and show a distinctive FR. More than the variability across spectra among their taxa, they found large variability in the frequency-dependent TS distributions which may be more useful, and identify specific frequencies that would be most useful to discriminate species in this study.

However, they didn't consider the body of the fish besies the swim bladder and the contribution to backscatter. There is also a need to identify depth-dependent variability.
