## Title:
Micro-geographic population genetic structure within Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in Beaufort Sea of Alaska
## Keywords:
arctic cod, beaufort sea, genetic patch, population genetic
## Geographic Coverage
Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Little evidence of genetic diversification to identify source and life history characteristics of Arctic cod in the Beaufort Sea, though fine-scale divergence of population genetics within the Southern Beaufort Shelf, likely due to Mackenzie outflow.

## Notes:
The physical oceanography of the Beaufort is structured by water from 3 areas: Pacific water, water from the slope/basin, and Mackenzie shelf water, and this translates to variability in biota. Distribution of organisms is likely dependent on abiotic changes. It is both difficult to track larval dispersal and we know that Arctic cod are capable of traveling long distances, so the use of fenetics could aid in determining population connectivity. They map genetic divergences to identify barriers in connectivity and fine-scale patterns.

Samples were taken from five years (2008,2010,2011,2013,and 2014) from the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Gulf of St. Lawrence from various surveys. Samples were amplified and sequenced. There was no temporal variation in alleles across years so samples were pooled. 82 mitochondrial haplotypes were characterized among 407 fish. microsatellite genotypes were taken from 740 individuals.

- No association was found between genetic dictance and geographic distance at the broad scale
- two mitochondiral lineages but no geographic pattern ini the haplotypes, with little variation across regions.
- Higher levels of divergence were found in the southern Beaufort which may be the result of seasonal variations due to the Mackenzie outflow.
