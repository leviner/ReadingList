## Keywords:
arctic cod, density distribution, prelagic survey
## Geographic Coverage
U.S. Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
08/06/2008 - 08/22/2008
## Significance:
Investigation of the offshore distribution of Arctic cod in the U.S. Beaufort Sea to examine the density and water property associations.

## Notes:
Distribution of prelagic fishes may be influenced byt eh physical oceanography of the Beaufort.  Outflow from Barrow Canyon moves eastwad in a surface layer or subsurface jet along the shelfbreak.  Near freezing waters remain on the shelf year round, while large riverine outputs can lead to major fluxes in space and time.

Acoustic data were collected at 38kHz using an ES60, .512ms pulse length at 1Hz, collected only during daytime, with trawling along transect lines to verify species composition.  CTD profiles were taken and interpolated between casts.  CTDs were spaced by half the distance of the rossby radius of demoration (the distance water can spread due only to gravity and rotation).  All sampling was done from 20-500m isobaths.

A marinovich net was used for midwater trawls of 10-60 minutes depending on acoustic target density.  All fish >60mm in length were sorted to species, weighed and lengthed.  For fish <60mm, the catch was subsampled.

Target strength was calculated from measurements before, during, and after the trawls.  Sawada indexing was applied using an estimated -60 for age-0 and -55 for adult.

For analysis, linear regression and GAM models were used, checked for normality, and selected based on AIC.

Physical Oceanography:
- Western transect: upper 20 meters were fresh <30, freshest of the survey, with near surface temps of 3.5 to 4.5C, getting colder (<2C) moving offshore (35km).  Coldest temperatures corresponded with meltwater.
- Strong halocline at ~25m depth, then gradual increase to a max of 33.5PSU around 14m deep.
- On the east end, and upwelling event occurred, spreading the halocline possibly due to a split in the shelfbreak front, and a freshwater lens caused by river runoff forced westward.

Arctic cod dominated all of the trawl catches in all regions.  Age-1+ lengths ranged from 65-190mm, with an average of 104 (+-9)mm.  Fish caught in the 40-100m bathymetric region were larger compared with the deeper (100-500m) region.

Age-0 A. cod lengths ranged from 30-60mm, and were not significantly different throughout the bathymetric regions.

New TS relationship of TS = 8.03 x log10(L)-60.78 which was used for all polar cod in the study.

No Age-1+ fish were estimated in the 20-40m bathymetric region either in acoustics nor in trawling.  Age-0 fish densities ranged from 4 to 160k individuals per hectare, with the highest densities inshore.

Density distributions of age-0 vs. age-1+ differed relative to bathymetric regions.  Age 1+ fish were greatest at bottom depths of >100m, with peak densities in the 150-300m depth range.  Age-0 fish were highest in bottom depth <100m but were observed in epipelagic layers in regions where bottom was deeper than 150m.

Age-0 fish were twice as dense in the 20-40m region than the other two, though high across all regions.

Neither age-1+ nor age-0 fish showed any significant relationship to any habitat descriptors, except for age-1+fish and temperature below the mixed-depth layer

Discussion
- Age1+
  - mean size smaller than that observed in coastal demersal sampling (104 vs 132 mm)
  - The specimen are likely between age 1 and age 2 unless length-at-age differs significantly from that in canadian waters
  - The range of densities in this study are on the low end of published summer densities, but this is likely due to surveying across pelagic layers rather than in discrete schools.
  - This study may not have reached the seaward extent of the age-1+ polar cod distributions near the survey area.
  - Highest densities in deep cold, and saline waters.
    - Deep water was likely of chukchi origin.
- Age-0 fishes
  - lengths were similar than that reported in previous CHukchi and Beaufort observations, differences may be due to sampling gear
  - Peak densities observed in the surface waters nearshore, typically in warm and low saline (<32) waters

Previously published TS estimates differ were either based on different or unknown length distributions that may not have included multiple age classes.
