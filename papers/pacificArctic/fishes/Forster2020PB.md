## Title:
Spatial patterns, environmental correlates, and potential seasonal migration triangle of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) distribution in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas
## Keywords:
arctic cod, migration triangles, pacific arctic, chukchi sea, beaufort sea
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Environmental and spatial associations of different size class arctic cod in the Chukchi and Beaufort, finding strongest associations with BCSW for small fish and depth for large fish.

## Notes:
Our understanding of the basic life history of organisms in the Pacific Arctic is based off snapshots, rather than multiyear syntheses. Growth and ontogenetic shifts in diet and swimming ability likely drive changes in distribution in Arctic cod as their size-specific resource availability changes. In "migration triangle" theory, species migrate from nursery grounds, to feeding grounds, to spawning grounds, and these types of seasonal migrations can be common in areas such as the North Pacific where seasonality is strong.

Data were used from 21 cruises from 2004 - 2017, from as early as June to mid-October.  All cod estimates are from PSBT CPUE standardized to fish per 1000 m2. In total, ~6500 fish from the Chukchi and ~2750 fish from the Beaufort. Length modes correspond to age 0, age 1, and age 2+. GAM model was used to correlate with environmental conditions.

Results & Discussion
- Latitudinal gradient in abundance in Chukchi, highest abundance in the North
  - Smaller fish were in the north with the BCSW, medium fish were evenly distributed, and larger fish were less abundant nearshore, with high abundance south of cape lisburne.
- Longitudinal gradient in the Beaufort, highest abundance to the west
  - Smaller fish were more abundant to the west, driving overall abundance, and nearshore. Larger fish were more abundant offshore (>60km)
- Environmental influence appeared to be size-class dependent
  - For small fish, temperature and salinity were the only variables indicating a peak around 4-5C and 34.5 PSU
  - Medium and large fish: abundance increased linearly with depth
  - Everything was similar in the Beaufort, except the medium fish associated with depth to ~300m and temperature, and large fish to 400m before declining
  - Strongest association between age-0s and BCSW in the Chukchi, but in the Beaufort are largely associated with the warm coastal water associated with ACW, occupying the warmest water potentially to maximize growth.
  - Depth is an indicator of offshore migration with growth, aligning with observations of Arctic cod in Atlantic water in the Beaufort.
- Seasonality (2017 sampling)
  - In spring, cod were sparse (n=4), and all individuals were large
  - In summer, all fish were small
  - Small fish may be transported out to the beaufort via the ACC
  - The two distinct groups of small fish in the beaufort indicate that there may be two populations, and that the population in the eastern beaufort likely did not originate from the same place as the fish in the west. This matches with potential genetic differentiation between populations in other studies.
  - It looks like medium and large fish actively disperse in areas different than smaller fish, based on the association with depth and offshore and the improved dispersal capabilities with size. Mid-sized individuals may be dispersing to productive feeding grounds to maximize fitness.
  - In both years of June sampling, the ice edge had already retreated much earlier and the low abundance is potentially a result of the fish following the ice.
  - The migration triangle is proposed based on other observations though the only evidence here is further identification of environmental associations
    - Small fish in the north Chukchi nursery, subadults in the NE chukchi and slope feeding, adults come back south resulting in the larval transport back to the NE Chukchi.
