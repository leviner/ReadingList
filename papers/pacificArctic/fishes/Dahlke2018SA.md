## Title:
Northern cod species face spawning habitat losses if global warming exceeds 1.5°C
## Keywords:
climate, temperature, larvae, arctic cod, habitat, range
## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Investigating the mpact of temperature and pCO2 on egg and larval development from broodstock. Additionally, they model loss of appropriate spawning areas based on future climate scenarios.

## Notes:
Asessed the range of thermal tolerance of gadids under OA conditions of future climate.

Oxygen consumption in embryos increased with increasing temperature, but reached a threshold in polar cod at >4.5C, at which point there was significant heat stress. Under elevated pCO2, there was also ~10% elevated oxygen consumption. However under warming and pCO2 increase this reversed (oxygen demands cant be met under increased OA).

Egg survival decreased at higher temperatures and under the influence of pCO2, and egg tolerances were smaller than larvae.

Currently, the thermally suitable spawning area is larger than where spawning occurs. Under future climate scenarios, this suitable area is likely to shift, with more northern areas becoming suitable.  However these colder regions may be less optimal given the thermal tolerance of atlantic cod under OA conditions. Polar cod spawning areas south of svalbard will be reduced, and a significant amount of its under ice habitat will be lost.
