## Title:

## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage
Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
06/01/2004 - 10/01/2013
## Significance:
Vestfals et al aim to narrow down the potential spawning grounds for arctic and saffron cod based on the physical oceanography and summer distribution.  It contains a good review in the intro of the current literature on early life history.

## Notes:
Great overview into on A cod life history; eggs are pelagic and buoyant, develop under ice or recently cleared, temperature dependent hatching (35 days at 1.5 and 78 days at -1.5), pelagic juveniles descend as they grow.

Data came from icthyoplankton surveys (NOAA, RUSALCA) and the AIES 2012-13 data.

cod abundance = g1*day + g2*bottom depth + g3*temperature + g4*salinity
or spatially as abundance = s of (lat, lon)
- julian day was one of the largest factors in explaining distribution (8/23 peak)
- abundance up with increasing bottom depth
- abundance down with increasing temperature
- abundance up at extreme (low and high) salinities
all data was done using mean water column temperatures and salinities

spatial patterns in acoustic data accounted for most of the deviance, abundance varied strongly with temperature

Earlier ice melt will improve recruitment of arctic cod in the fall, until a point when their thermal tolerances are exceeded.

Their large-scale summer distributions are relatively insensitive to variability in environmental forcing"

increased population could be due to open water feature

Concluding hypotheses
* Habitat partitioning at the larval and juvenile stages, with minimal overlap
* weak associations with water depth contrasted with strong associations with temperature and salinity likely reflect associations with water masses, controlled by interannual change in dominant circulation patterns
* **Distribution is driven by advection**
* Changes between 2012 and 2013 were likely due to wind-induced changes in the distribution of water masses
* Could be a movement of eggs from the Beaufort with increased up-canyon flow resulting in more southern distribution.  reduced ACC leads to retention of fish in the south
