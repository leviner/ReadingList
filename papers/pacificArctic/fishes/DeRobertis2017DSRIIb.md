## Significance:
Two broad-scale baseline acoustic-trawl surveys were conducted in 2012 and 2013.

## Notes:
There are no large-scale commercial fisheries in the U.D. north of the Bering Strait, and the Chukchi sea ecology, particularly the pelagic ecosystem, remain poorly understood.

Surveys were conducted in 2012 and 2013, with the primary goal of establishing abundance and distribution estimates for Arctic cod and the other dominant pelagic species in the northern Bering and Chukchi using acoustic-trawl (AT) surveys, a well established method in low-diversity ecosystems.

Due to the presence of mixed-species assemblages, the assumption that all of the backscatter was A. cod could not be made in all cases, and methods were developed for proportional allocation of backscatter.

Determining species abundance/biomass:
- Trawl catches were corrected for selectivity (by species and size class)
- sigmaBS was claculated for a given species and given size class
- proportional backscatter of a given species and given size class for a given trawl is calculated as the proportion of the number of those individuals times their sigma BS and the total backscatter of all individuals
- SA<sub>i</sub> was allocated as the total SA at location *i* times the proportional backscatter value determined for that species/length class.
- Abundance is then the SA allocated to that species/length divided by 4*pi*sigmaBS

The survey was divided into 1x1 degree grid cells for analyses.

Arctic cod, saffron cod, capelin, and pacific herring accounted for 98.2% of individuals and 77.1% of total weight in midwater trawls, and 85.5% and 18.5% in surface trawls.  Biomass was dominated in all samples in both years by jellyfish, primarily C. melanaster.

Arctic cod length in the Chukchi averaged ~3.5cm and <.3% of fish caught were greater than 6.5cm.  A. cod were 1-2 orders of magnitude more abundant than the other dominant pelagic species throughout the survey area in both years, and 2.7 time higher in 2013 than 2012.

Saffron cod were abundant coastally between 66.5 and 69.5N, and 4x more abundant in 2013 than 2012.  Capelin were patchily distributed throughout the survey area, and Herring were mostly only observed near Bering Strait and in the north Bering Sea.

91% in 2012 and 95% in 2013 of Arctic cod were north of 69.25N, and tended to be located in deeper regions of the survey area.  

They conducted a sensitivity analysis on alternate post-processing scenarios to determine the impact on the allocation of backscatter.  Scenario 3 - nearest haul with a separation of midwater and surface zones, had minimal (<10%) changes and is a good argument for nearest haul when only doing midwater trawling.

An exploratory survey was conducted near Barrow Canyon showing an epipelagic scattering layer which was determined to be age-0 arctic cod, and a weak scattering layer at depth (>280m) had a higher abundance of larger arctic cod (24% were > 7cm).  This deep layer was associated with warmer and more saline Atlantic water.

Overall, midwater fishes caught were small, consistent with previous observations.  A cod, saffron cod, and capelin were consistently associated with a specific range of environmental conditions, with A cod showing preference for intermediate temperatures and high salinities, while saffron cod were found in warmer and fresher waters, mostly coastal masses.  Temperature appears to drive habitat partitioning between A and S cod.

Waters were colder in 2013 than 2012, and advective flow off the shelf was weaker, so there was a possible increase in retention relative to 2012.

Proportional backscatter estimations are best suited to stronger scatterers where erroneous predictions lead to smaller variability in abundance estimates.

The fish were small and net retention was very low, making selectivity calculations important, particularly when the selectivity varies between the two nets being used.

Using nearest-haul estimations replaces the subjective nature of user-assigned backscatter-trawl associations.  Additionally, population estimates are strongly sensitive to TS used to calculate abundance.

The large number of Arctic cod in the chukchi in both years is comparable to the number of YOY pollock observed in the EBS, which is attributed to a large spawning stock, so the same is likely true for A cod, and the Chukchi appears to serve as a nursery for A cod.  Age 1+ fish  densities on the chukchi shelf are substantially lower than the age-0 fish, suggesting that survivorship is either very low or that these fish move to other areas.

It remains to be determined where the age-0 fish observed were spawned, and the distribution outside of the ice-free summer months is unknown.

Fish in the northern chukchi experience warmer conditions than those in the high arctic, supporting faster growth rates, increasing size and reducing overwinter mortality.

Concluding hypotheses
* Lower temperatures favor Arctic cod while higher temperatures favor saffron cod and herring: "population dynamics and dispersal mechanisms of pelagic fishes in the Pacific Arctic are coupled with the variable environmental conditions"
* Age-0 Arctic cod either emigrate from the northern chukchi shelf or do not survive over winter
