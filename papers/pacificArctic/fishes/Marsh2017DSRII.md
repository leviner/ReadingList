## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
08/07/2012 - 09/25/2013
## Significance:
Examined the isoscapes and relation to water masses in the Chukchi Sea, looking for diet niches of pelagic fishes, particularly Arctic cod.

## Notes:
Species richness in the Chukchi declines from warm to cold waters.  Arctic cod are the most dominant of pelagic species and are the key trophic link.  To evaluate the impact of future changes on the fish community, it is necessary to understand the diets.

Del-15 N is used to asses trophic level (step-wise enrichment from prey to predator) while Del-13 C is conserved through trophic levels.

Objectives: 1) create isoscapes of the Chukchi 2) describe ontogenetic diets 3) asses spatial variability in del-15 N by class 4) asses the role of arctic cod in the foodweb in relationship with the water masses.

In 2012, it appears that age-1+ A. cod fed mostly pelagically in BCSW than melt water.  Age-0 fish had overlapping feeding ranges in both years, indicating a similar diet regardless of year and water mass.  

The fish community in the ACW had the highest variability in Del-15N, indicating the broadest diversity of resources.  Fish in the MW had the smallest rage, with most confined niche.  Fish in the BCSW fell somewhere between the two, indicating that they are relying more on pelagic prey than the MW, though food chain lengths were similar between all 3.

Trophic positions shift with onotogeny, with a general increase in Del-15N with body length, and a shift from pelagic to benthic prey (from del-13C) was observed in the gadids.

A. cod are generalist zooplanktivors.  There was an increase n the C:N ratios for fish feeding in the BCSW where there is a higher abundance of lipid-rich calanoid copepods.  ACW and BCSW waters were colder in 2013, offering fewer nutrients to support pelagic production, possibly leading to greater reliance on benthic prey.

Community resilience depends on resource availability, complexity, and functional redundancy (number of species filling similar roles).  There is thus a competitive advantage when the bering sea influence is greater (more northern extension of BCSW) which draws on a greater resource base.  Arctic cod were present and successful across all water masses, indicating some resilience, particu larly as age-1+.

Age-0 tend to remain out of the ACW, and may remain more vulnerable to prey and climate shifts.

Concluding hypotheses
* Fish in offshore waters (BCSW and MW) may have an advantage over those in coastal waters in terms of prey quality or quantity if higher energetic values reflect the ability to allocate energy to lipid storage
