## Significance:
Characterization of the zooplankton and pelagic fish community in relation to the physical and biological properties of the water masses in the northern Bering and southern Chukchi Seas.

## Notes:
Though demersal fish assemblages in the northern Bering and southern Chukchi have been completed in recent years, a similar analysis of the pelagic community has not occurred.

Zooplankton distributions tend to be associated with water masses, while the distribution of ELS fish may be associated with bathymetry and currents.  In the N Bering and Chukchi, the strong gradients in the physical conditions may set distinct habitats and thus pelagic communities.

CTDs, Juday nets, Bongo Nets, and a Cantrawl were used for biological collection.

Six water column structures were identified from a cluster analysis, with various combinations of surface and bottom water compositions.  The most prevalent water masses were ACW (with high salinity), BSW, and BSAW.  Mixed layer depths were shallow and increased from onshore to offshore.  Surface nutrients increased from onshore to offshore, with the highest dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in BSAW, both in surface and bottom layers.

Large zooplankton main groups were 59% copepods, 25% euphausiids, and 6% larvaceans.  Small zooplankton main groups were 52% meroplankton and 39% copepods.  Large zooplankton were almost twice the biomass of small zooplankton, though small zooplankton were slightly more abundance.
- Large zooplankton were concentrated offshore in higher salinity water masses
- Small zooplankton were more evenly distributed, with the highest abundances in the ACW.

Fish were captured in surface waters:
-Saffron cod were in nearshore waters with highest mean abundances in surface ACW waters
- Polar cod most abundant in high salinity ACW

Discussion

Water, Nutrients, and PP:
- Four water masses were found, with two components (high and low salinity) of the ACW.
- Primary production was highest in surface BSW regions, and the composition of phytoplankton varies between the BSW and ACW, with larger particles in the BSE than the ACW
- High light attenuation in the ACW due to river discharge

Species Composition:
- Large copepods (and subarctic species) dominated the offshore regions, and were most abundant in the BSAW suggesting advection
- Stronger link between zooplankton and bottom water than surface waters- Pelagic fish community correlated strongly with latitude.
