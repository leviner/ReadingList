## Significance:
Modeled connectivity of age-0 pollock population to spawning locations in the Eastern Bering. Patterns mostly follow along-isobath flow, though differ between warm and cold years.

## Notes:
In the EBS, pollock spawn consistently at 2 locations; just north of unimak pass and near the priblof islands. The currents and frontal structure on the Bering shelf affect the transport of larval fishes, and the distributions of early life stages of pollock change between warm and cold years. Models suggest that spawning locations and their proximity to physical features and forcings drive difference in ELS distribution.

Used an IBM (Petrik 2015), utilizing TRACMASS to simulate transport within the ROMS. Individuals were initiated at the egg stage within the two spawning regions in 10-meter depth increments. The model variations were:
- transport only (cold years and warm years)
- contracted spawning area due to cold pool
- expanded spawning area due to warmer shelf
- late spawning
- early spawning

Individuals were tracked until they hit 40mm length. Connectivity was defined by the percent of individuals from a spawning area that end up within the same region at 40mm timing.

Connectivity to the middle shelf was stronger in warm years, and the inner shelf was stronger in cold years. In general there were three patterns of strong connectivity:
- along iso-bath currents to the NW
- shelf retention
- persistence near priblofs

Slight bathymetric features (canyons, shelf break) appear to have a strong impact on connectivity as the have an outweighted impact on flow. Flow is also strongly seasonal, with greater transport in the early simulations and higher retention in later ones. Total eastward transport was greater in warm years, matching a shifted aleutian low.

Modeled observations did not match distributions observed in surveys, mostly spatially which could be due to behavior and mortality. The priblof region, with strong connectivity, could be a nursery area for age-0s.
