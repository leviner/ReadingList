## Title:
Recent warming leads to a rapid borealization of fish communities in the Arctic
## Keywords:
arctic, warming, expansion, community, invasion
## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea
## Field Dates:
01/01/2004 - 12/31/2014
## Significance:
Evidence of rapid borealization in the Barents sea through community-wide geographic shifts from 2004-2012, credited to the northward expansion of thermal habitat for boreal species. Consequences for shifting energy pathways.

## Notes:
Species exhibit different sensitivities to climate warming such as thermal tolerance, dispersion ability, and resource exploitation. Climate impacts at high latitudes therefore can alter community structure on large spatial scales.

In the Barents Sea, the Atlantic meets the Arctic ocean, and there is a zoogeographical divide between water bodies, with the frontal zone serving as a biogeographic border between arctic and boreal species.

Observations of demersal fish population from 2004 to 2012. Bottom water temperatures and mixed-water area increased due to increased inflow of warmer Atlantic water.
- the shallow, warm-water fish associated Atlantic community expanded the most
- Deeper atlantic fish did not expand range but remained in the deep basins
- The arctic community retracted into the northernmost section of the survey area

Tracking species abundances, several northern-associated species decreased in abundance, so they consider this a "take-over", and with further loss these species could become locally extinct. Expansion of the range of larger predators could alone explain the decrease in distribution of colder fishes.

Changes in ice and subsequent cooling may change the phenology of species.

These changes have implications for biodiversity, structure, energy balance, and trophic pathways.
