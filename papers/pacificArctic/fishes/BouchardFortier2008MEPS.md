## Title:
Effects of polynyas on the hatching season, early growth and survival of polar cod Boreogadus saida in the Laptev Sea
## Keywords:
arctic cod, ice, polynya, hatching, survival
## Geographic Coverage
Laptev Sea
## Field Dates:
09/01/2003 - 09/21/2005
## Significance:
Observations of larval Arctic cod populations in a high polynya occurrence (2005) and low occurrence (2003) year.  Conclude that maximizing pre-winter size is more important than matching food availability when hatching, and freshwater input (warm) promotes earlier hatching a growth to maximize both size at age and pre-winter success.

## Notes:
High phytoplankton abundance and temperature in polynyas promote feeding and growth of copepods and early stage arctic cod.  Hatching of b. saida in the Laptev is hypothesized to occur from mid-May to mid-July in the NE polynya.  Here, they use otoliths to determine hatch dates to look at the role of polynyas and ice on growth.

Polar cod were sampled in September of 2003 and 2005 with zooplankton nets.  Polynyas opened earlier and more frequently in 2005 than in 2003.  The area of ice free water in Jan/Feb was 3-5 times larger in 2005 than in 2003, by March, there was more open water in 2003.  170 b. saida were collected in 2003 (shallow, 100-200m) hatched mostly from mid-March to July, and 427 were collected in 2005 (mostly along 1000m isobath) hatched continually from January to July.  Average age and length were linear correlated to salinity at the surface.

The slopes of the length at age did not vary significantly between years, but the intercepts were significantly different, meaning fish of the same age were larger in 2005, meaning there were differences in the length at age that were not due to the hatching length.  Estimates of early growth during the first 2 months were greater in 2005 than in 2003.  B. saida larvae were significantly longer at age in 2005 than in 2003 from late April to mid-June (Fig. 9), a period corresponding to the wider opening of the southern polynyas in 2005 relative to 2003.

Interpretation:
1. Prey availability and summer temperatures dictate the hatching season.  Where long open-water exists, high food availability and warm waters lead to faster growing larvae.  Regions with a short ice-free period, larvae must hatch early in winter or spring to reach their minimum pre-winter size because of the slow growth and food availability under ice.
2. Winter temperature dictates the hatching season by limiting survival. In coastal seas influenced by large rivers, temperatures above -1.8 in the brackish upper water column allow b. saida to grow in winter.  Regions with less freshwater influence have extrememly low temps under ice, which could prevent swimming and feeding in early hatchers.  This would limit the hatching window to spring/summer for fish in cold conditions, while expanding it for those in warm, brakish conditions as early as january.

Polynyas:
- Larval b. saida are visual predators, so any increase in light, even diffuse is beneficial
- Hatching frequency in January and february was significantly correlated to the fraction of open water
- much fewer fish from pre-March in 2003, which is when a much larger fraction of ice opened up
- availability of plankton prey, there appears to be enough of a range in various copepod species that in winter and early spring, naupliar stages of copepods and eggs of arctic species would be available in the water column

There's a tradeoff between low survival of early hatching a pre-winter size.  Large early hatchers can better avoid visual predators.  Interannually, the larger length-at-age was associated with higher frequency of polynyas.  The average pre-winter length in 2005 was was 8.6mm larger than in 2003, reflecting fast initial growth and the presence of earlier hatched fish.

Hypothesis:
* maximizing pre-winter size to reduce predation rather than matching food availability is the main force dictating winter/spring hatching in b. saida.
* The survival of larvae in the Laptev could be favored by the increased occurrence of polynyas
