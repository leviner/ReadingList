## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage
Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
08/02/1977 - 06/10/1978
## Significance:
Observations of the biology of Arctic cod caught in bottom trawls in late-summer, 1977.

## Notes:
Arctic cod were collected in the north Bering, NE Chukchi, western Beaufort, and Central Beaufort using an otter trawl.  Stomach contents were ranked according to abundance.  Ages were determined from otoliths.  All of the tows were near pack ice.

Arctic cod were most abundant in the NE Chukchi and western Beaufort.  They hypothesize this may be due to the northward movement of fish from the Bering and southern Chukchi with the receding ice edge.  Gonads were not well developed in preparation for spawning, corresponding to the understanding that development doesn't occur until fall.

Fish in the NE Chukchi were smaller with a mean of 8.8cm, as opposed to 14.7 cm in the Bering. 1) fishes in the Bering were much older.  4-yeasr old fish were only caught in the Bering, with mostly 1yo in the Chukchi and Beufort. 2) Length at age was greater in the Bering than Chukchi 3) Small fish were proportionally abundant at depths <100m.

It appears that the greatest growth in length occurs in the 2nd year in the Chukchi, relative to studies in the Barents Sea.  growth rates may be strongly influenced by food availability.  Diets in the chukchi sea were mostly pelagic prey, calanus glacialis and hyperboreus, euchata, and metridia.  Bering sea diet had a greater component of shrimps, gammarid amphipods, and mysids.  Hyperiid amphipods were mostly eaten by larger fish, and chaetognaths by smaller fish.
