## Title:
Egg incubation and larval rearing of navaga (Eleginus navaga Pall.), polar cod (Boreogadus saida lepechin) and arctic flounder (Liopsetta glacialis Pall.) in the laboratory
## Keywords:
arctic cod, development, egg, incubation
## Geographic Coverage
White Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Early description of Arctic cod egg and larval stages through incubation experiments, with developmental timing and growth rates

## Notes:
A cod development:
- A. cod eggs are translucent, 1.72 - 1.9 mm in diameter.
- They observe hatching of polar cod between 26 and 35 days at a mean temperature of 0
- A. cod do not react to light in their first few days after hatching and are distributed throughout the water column (in lab)
- First feeding after hatching was at about 12 days, and took about 22 days total to utilize entire yolk sac
- Percent of fish feeding increased from 25% (day 14) to 65% (day 26)
- Swim bladder filling: At 6.4-6.5mm in length, only 1-2% had a filled swim bladder, while at 7.1-7.2mm, 65% had their swim bladder filled.  This corresponds to 22-24 days after hatching (so about 2 months after spawn at 0C)
- There is a definite relationship with swim bladder being filled and feeding
