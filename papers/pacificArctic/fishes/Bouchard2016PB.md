## Title:
Contrasting the early life histories of sympatric Arctic gadids Boreogadus saida and Arctogadus glacialis in the Canadian Beaufort Sea
## Keywords:
arctic cod, hatch, diet distribution, growth
## Geographic Coverage
Canadian Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
04/01/2004 - 08/30/2008
## Significance:
Comparison of A. glacialis and B. saida early life stages, including hatching, feeding, length at age, and mortality over April to August in two years of freeze-in sampling.

## Notes:
In years of low b. saida abundance, Arctogadus glacialis can become an alternative prey source for some marine mammals.
- B. Saida: buoyant eggs rise to surface, hatch between 45-90 days (temp dependent), begin feeding at 12-14 days post hatch, with growth rates of .18 to .24mm/day, and juveniles of 7 to 57mm in August depending on hatch date.
- A. glacialis: spawn under ice, and larval stage is sometimes confounded with that of B. saida.  Eggs are reported to be demersal.

This study uses genetics and a new otolith identification technique to discriminate larval samples of the two species collected in the Canadian Beaufort in winter/spring/summer during freeze in cruises in 2004 and 2008.

Nets were deployed under ice or in open waters using various nets (double square net, ring net, multinet sampler).  Stratified sampling was conducted in some instances.  Individuals per unit volume were calculated.  A subsample were measured at sea, then the remainder were preserved and later corrected for shrinkage.

Fish were ID'd by either gmo8 microsatellite locus (3.4% misclassification) and/or lapillus otolith.  Otolith aging was done on a subset of fish collected.  Lengths and ages for unmeasured fish were assigned values from a frequency distribution of those measured.

- For fish sampled on the same day, A. glacialis tended to be larger than B. saida.  However the overlap in SL range in spring and hence the likelihood of misidentification was high
- Up to 35mm in length, there's a strong correlation between age and length.

Results
- Only 7.3% were A. glacialis
- Little overlap in size in spring, maximum overlap was in August samples
- In a given year, growth rate does not vary significantly between the two species
- 59% B. saida and 51% A glacialis caught within 10 meters of the surface from June to August
- Most young fishes were in the 5-10m during day and 0-5m at night
- Hatch dates for B. saida were from early march to late June, A. glacialis also began in late-March but late dates differed between years
  - based on corrections to distribution at age made based on mortality estimates, the most intense hatching period was from mid-April to late May, in 2008, peaking in April.
  - Ice retreat was ~20 days earlier in 2008, and B. saida hatching began approximately 3 weeks earlier relative to 2004
- Mortality rate was estimated based on catch at age, and was significantly higher for B. saida (4.6%/day) than A. glacialis (2.4%/day)
- Under ice, not all of the fish were feeding, and those that were had pseudocalanus copepodites/nauplii in their guts.
**They report a summary of equations and references for carbon content of common prey species for the juvenile gadids**
- Calanus nauplii and invert eggs were most of the B. saida carbon uptake.  In larger (> 25mm) larvae, calanus copepodites were the most important carbon source.  Naupliar stages are important carbon sources under ice, this the early feeding success could depend on the grazing of nauplii on ice algae.

In summer/late larval stages, there is a small amplitude DVM, and greater food abundance near the surface must outweigh predation risk.  Both species hatch timings and distributions appear to fit the theory that hatching is timed to maximize pre-winter growth during the first year.

In larval pelagic stage, the two species are similar geographically, in growth rate, hatching season, and morphology.  Divergences may reduce competition:
- A. glacialis is larger at hatch
- mortality rate is twice as high in B. saida
- the first feeding larvae have slightly different prey items even though they were of similar size
- scarcity of A. glacialis in the sampling area is reflected in the abundance of the early life stages

The larger size at age likely is an advantage for A. glacialis, as observed by the lower mortality rate, and a more predictable food source may be what helps them persist with smaller population sizes relative to B. saida.
