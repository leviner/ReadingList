## Title:
Pelagic production and the recruitment of juvenile polar cod Boreogadus saida in Canadian Arctic seas
## Keywords:
arctic cod, recruitment, ice breakup, bloom
## Geographic Coverage
Baffin Bay, Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
06/01/2006 - 10/01/2017
## Significance:
Acoustic surveys in the canadian arctic show correlation with polar cod biomass and earlier ice breakup date.

## Notes:
Here, they use new data of an expanded time series from 2006 to 2017 across the canadian arctic to look at the correlation between ice breakup date and the biomass of juvenile arctic cod.

Observations of arctic cod came from a series of hydroacoustic surveys. Standard length was measured at sea from net collections, and biomass was extiimated based on Geoffroy et al 2017 length-weight relationships. MVBS was used to descriminate fish (-10, benoit et al 2014).  Similarly they made an estimate of zooplankton from 120 kHz. Ice and Chl a were collected using satellite (MODIS/SSMI) remote sensing.

Results
- Phytoplankton bloom onset was significantly correlated with ice breakup week. Earlier ice melt meant earlier bloom.
- Zooplankton backscatter in august was higher with an earlier ice breakup.
- Age-0 biomass in august was higher with earlier ice breakup..
- Age-0 biomass was higher with greater zooplankton backscatter.

Earlier ice breakup allows for an earlier phytoplankton bloom as light increases. First feeding arctic cod eat nauplii and early copepods, and an earlier ice breakup means earlier production of zooplankton.

Arctic cod can be dependent on early ice breakup due to a) higher recruitment in late summer could provide larvae with a longer growing season at minimum, where a warmer summer wont affect recruitment. b) warmer SST and an increase in pelagic production could maximize pre-winter size.
