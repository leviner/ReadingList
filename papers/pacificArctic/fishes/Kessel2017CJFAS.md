## Title:
First documented large-scale horizontal movements of individual Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida)
## Keywords:
arctic cod, beaufort sea, genetic patch, population genetic
## Geographic Coverage
Canadian Acrtic
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Observations of tagged Arctic cod 192 km distance away from tagginng, suggesting large-scale horizontal migration, with estimates of rate.

## Notes:
Because of the small size of these fish, it has been difficult to conduct movement studies on Arctic cod in the past, and most studies have occured over short time scales. Here, they use the Ocean Tracking Network observtions to document large-scal horizontal movements of Arctic cod intially observed in Resolute Bay (see Kessel et al., 2016).

- Arctic cod were surveyed, captured, and tagged in Resolute bay between August 2012 and April 2013 (see Kessel et al., 2016 for methods). In 2011, a separate receiver array was set up at the mouth of Maxwell bay, 192 km to the east of Resolute Bay. This data was recovered in September 2015.
- 5 of the 85 Arctic cod initially tagged in Resolute Bay were detected on the Maxwell receiver line (all adults).
- While this is the first documented, it is likely that fish in other regions make these horizontal migrations, as it has been observed that larger fish seek out deeper waters under ice cover, which are not available in shallow shelves where they have been observed.
- The low number of detections indicates that these fish were likely not residing the the area for long but swimming pat the receiver line.
- The earliest arrival was 67 days, which translates to 0.033 m/s swim rate (2.87 km/day). At swim speeds of .9-1 body lengths/s, it is feasible even with countercurrent conditions.
- Based on ice cover and likelihood of the tag passing through a predators system, it is likley that these were actual fish.
