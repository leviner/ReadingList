## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
01/01/2016 - 01/31/2017
## Significance:
Observations of mesopelagic scattering layers in the high arctic, describing the seasonality of the SSL, including the condition of the organisms and trophic interactions.

## Notes:
Acoustic-trawl surveys of the Arctic north of Svalbard in winters of 2016 and 2017, plus a survey in summer 2017 to look at the seasonal variation in the fish and zooplankton community of the SSK.

Sampling was conducted with a pelagic trawl, ~10x11m mouth, with a 1cm inner liner. Communitiy variation was done with a UPGMA cluster analysis. Fatty acid markers were analyzed to look at energy flow, and used a CA to look at breakdown.

The vertical distribution of the SSL was >200m deeper in summer than in winter, driven mostly be animals in the deep basin rather than epipelagic slope water.  In winter, fish community was dominated by redfish species. In summer, arctic cod were a larger portion of the SSL biomass.

80% of the variation in the CA was explained by one axis which defined four groups: cod/herring, large lipid krill, shanny and lanternfish, redfish and smaller krill.

Most organisms followed the Atlantic water mass. In January the SSL was thicker and more dense on the slope than in the basin. The sA in summer is more similar to that in boreal regions.

Species assemblages varied seasonally, where in summer arctic cod dominated the biomass of pelagic fishes. This may be dependent on year-class effects.

Two primary food webs; calanus based (summer) and krill based (summer). The few arctic cod collected in summer also had krill in their diet. For many of the smaller krill (T. inermis), the lipid reserves are too small to survive winter in the arctic. By August, calanus already begin their descent to depth.
