## Title:

## Significance:
Laboratory temperature experiments were conducted on gadidae to investigate the importance of temperature on fish growath and survival.  Arctic fishes can grow faster at cooler temperatures, but have a limited range.  Their ability to grow under future climate scenarios is presented.

## Notes:
Temperature is the most important environmental component of development, growth and survival, and areas such as the Arctic ocean are increasing at a rate of ~.5C/decade.

Arctic cod (Beaufort Sea), saffron cod (Beaufort Sea), pacific cod (GoA), and walleye pollock (Puget Sounds) were all collected live and transported to Newport to be raised in tanks with temperature controls.

Growth experiments were conducted on fish between 65 and 120 mm, depending on species.  Experimental temperatures were 0, 5 , 9, 16, and 20 C, with an increase between experiments of 1.5/day.  Results:
- Saffron cod survived at all temperatures, limited to no mortality at 16 and 20C.  They could grow at all temperatures and maintain maximum (>80%) growth across the broadest temperature range.
- Arctic cod were "visibly stressed" after 2 weeks of 16C exposure.  Arctic cod were capable of the highest growth at the lowest temperature treatment
- Walleye pollock had a clear growth advantage at temps > 2.5 C
- Pacific cod had the advantage at temps > 5 C

Concluding hypotheses
* Arctic cod should seek >2C temperature water (up to 7-8C) when food is abundant
* Boundary zones (thermal-salinity fronts) in warm water could serve as an important nursery habitat, but could also become dangerous if temperatures get too high (14)
* "...continued climate change will eventually lead to reduced thermal habitat...while increasing thermal habitat for the Pacific gadids"
* Arctic cod have a very high conversion efficiency from prey > fish biomass, replacement in the system or changes due to temperature dampening of that conversion could greatly inhibit energy flow in the arctic
