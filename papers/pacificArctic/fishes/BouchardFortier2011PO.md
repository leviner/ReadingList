## Significance:
This paper looks at the hatch date frequency distribution in six regions of differing freshwater input, and find evidence to support the winter refuge hypothesis that Arctic cod in lower saline environments have a greater pre-winter size due to faster development and earlier hatching.

## Notes:
Guiding hypothesis: salinity-induced variations in SST cause regional differences in the timing of hatching of A. cod.  Salinity is a proxy for freshwater input, and therefore potential temperature extremes (brackish water will be closer to freezing temperature because of the freshwwater while open ocean high-saline water can be ~-1.8C).

Prediction: hatching season begins in winter for fish near freshwater, and spring for those areas with little to no input.

Used previously published hatchdate frequency distributions (HFDs) and new HFDs from analyzed otoliths, from 1-3 different years in each region analyzed.

They validated the accuracy of their otolith reading for aging by marking the otoliths with oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) in live fish, allowing them to reacclimate and continue to grow.  Fish were then collected and aged at varying dates, and analyzed by light microscopy, then compared using SEM readings.

Some subset of otoliths were read, and a smaller portion was verified by a second reader.  The remaining fish collected were aged based on length and data from those that were aged.

HFD was consistent for a region across years:
- Laptev Sea: prolonged hatching period from December to July (205, 2007), and march-July (2003)
- Beaufort Sea: mid-February to June

HFDs became shorter and shifted from winter towards summer with decreasing regional freshwater input.  High input regions (Laptev Sea, Hudson Bay, Beaufort Sea) had an earlier hatch date than areas of high surface salinity.

Hatch date explained 90% of the variability in length of the fish caught in summer.  97% of A. cod > 35mm in length by mid-AUgust were from regions with high freshwater input.

They determined a negative relationship between length and hatch date: SL (8/14) = 49.87-0.203HD

These findings are consistent with the winter refuge hypothesis: the development of motility and feeding structures of A. cod are drastically reduced at cold temperatures, and the brackish conditions under ice plumes of river output would provide relatively warm temperatures (0 to -1) leading to more rapid egg development.  The HFDs here show a delay of hatching until spring in regions of low freshwater input.

The larger the juveniles are, the earlier they can migrate to depth to avoid predation from sea birds when ice clears (30-35mm).  

"This suggests that, in cold regions, the long growth season made possible by winter hatching in the thermal refuge provided by a river plume can actually overcompensate for slow early larval growth in producing large pre-winter sizes."

A large fraction of the juvenile population emerge in coincidence with the season of copepod egg and nauplii development in the surface waters.  Those that hatch early may prey on smaller omnivorous copepods which reproduce throughout the year, or even rotifers that are associated with the brackish water of river plumes/microbial food webs.

Earlier ice break up, increased polynya development, and warmer surface waters would favor earlier hatch dates.  Observations from the Laptev sea support this, where specimen in 2005 and 2007, years of warm and early ice retreat, had hatch dates as early as January, while in 2003, a "normal" ice year, no animals were found to have hatched earlier than March.

In situ overwintering experiments are necessary to further validate the thermal refuge hypothesis.

Concluding hypotheses
* Hatch date explains 90% of the variance in pre-winter size
* Growth is dictated by the surface conditions of the sampling region
* They support the hypothesis that under-ice river plumes and freshwater provide thermal refuge for faster development and earlier hatching.
