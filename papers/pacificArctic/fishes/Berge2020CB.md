## Title:
Artificial light during the polar night disrupts Arctic fish and zooplankton behaviour down to 200 m depth
## Keywords:
mesopelagic fish, fatty acid, zooplankton
## Geographic Coverage

## Significance:
Measurements of ship light influence on water column backscatter, which indicate that orientation change is likely responsible for rapid variability, and ship impacts are spatially limited.

## Notes:
We now know that these Arctic ecosystems are highly active under low-light conditions in winter. Therefore, they may be highly susceptible to artificial light, and continued warming and decreases in sea ice could lead to more activity in the Arctic winter.

They conducted 3 field experiments, using normal working lights from ships to look at light-induced impacts, and measured responses using net sampling and moored acoustics.
- Changes were different at all 3 stations
- Total acoustic backscatter reduction, in response to light, ranged from 4-54%
- The change in vertical distribution was minimal, indicating that rapid change in backscatter was a function of orientation
- At one station, backscatter increased with lights on.

It is important to know both the physical and biological factors, since there is no uniform response.


Light attenuation varied across the sites, such that the depth of ambient and ship light was highly variable.

They measured spatial impact of the ship lights by looking at change in backscatter from a surface mooring as the ship distance to that mooring changed.
-   The light footprint of the ship was 120m-180m, effects of the light appeared to be 50m

There are major implications for measurements of biomass derived from acoustic backscatter in dark regions, beyond the Arctic. This includes nighttime acoustic surveys conducted in lower latitude regions.
