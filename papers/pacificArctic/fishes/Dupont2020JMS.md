## Title:
Sea ice, temperature, and prey effects on annual variations in mean lengths of a key Arctic fish, Boreogadus saida, in the Barents Sea
## Keywords:
arctic cod, amphipod,length-at-age, warming
## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Variation in winter ice conditions is the main driver of polar cod length-at-age. Early ice retreat in the Brents leads to higher survival of early hatchers and possible faster growth, resulting in a larger length-at-age for age-0 cohort.

## Notes:
The Arctic is experiencing the greatest changes in warming, and sea ice cover is decreasing in the marginal seas. In the Barents, increased SST with the increasing intrusion of warm Atlantic water may allow for more boreal species to expand northward, and changing temperature can directly impact growth rates of arctic species.

Length-at-age fish stocks can be used to look at implications of changing climate to understand both direct and indirect impacts, since length-at-age is a function of both growth rate and size-dependenton mortality. For age-0 fishes, size may also be effected by length and timing of the spawning season. Increasing length-at-age is inidicative of a positive trend for a population resulting from good gortwh conditions and supporting greater resilience to changes in the environment and predation. Here they investigate the relationship between length-at-age and abiotic factors to improve the understanding climate change impacts on Arctic cod.

- They use abundance-weighted length distributions derived from 30 years of acoustic surveys in the Barents Sea. For age-0 fish, the same trawling process is done, but targeting the upper 60m of the water column.
- Summer SST (mean of May - September) was derived from satellite measurements
- Winter sea ice concentrations from the same grid as SST were calculated where the ice index for a given year represents the average ice cover from December - May  (6 months).
- August - september bottom water temperatures
- April Sea ice Coverage - Net primary production
- Three prey abundance indexes were created from net catches
  - Pelagic amphipods
  - copepods
  - krill
- Atlantic cod (biomass stock) and harp seal (modeled age structure) were included as predators

Mean length at age for each age class was regressed against all abiotic and biotic factors. Final models were produced using forward AIC calculations (i.e., adding variables to the regression one at a time against all combinations until the addition of a variable no longer decreased the AIC). The optimal models showed:
- Age 0: negatively related to winter ice concentrations
- Age 1: not associated with the previous year of the same class, negatively with sea ice coverage, and positively with amphipod index
- Age 2: positively associated with the previous year (big 1s mean big 2s), and negatively associated with sea ice concentration
- Age 3: negative association with amphipods, another model had a strong negative association with harp seals
- Age 4+: positive association with previous year only significant variable

Most rapid increases in length are associated with years of minimal sea ice. For age-0 fish, early retreat may mean early hatchers, which can grow larger, make up a greater proportion of the cohort by the first winter. Because of the large variation in hatch date within a year class, increased early season survival would likley both increase length-at-age and abundance/survival. This may be in contrast to the loss of spawning areas due to this loss in ice.

Sea ice in subsequent years may simply extend the duration of the suitable growth/feeding period for larger age-classes. In additin, increased secondary production due to earlier primary production may benefit these larger age classes. In low ice years, zooplankton concentrations start uncreasing earlier in the season, extending the feeding season for the cod. There were not clear strong associations with prey indices, which leads them to conclude that length of feeding season may be more important. However these indices were measured in fall at the end of the season and may not be representative of available resources.

SST no association, which is likely explained by (i) the importance of season length over temperature for age-0, and (ii) the deeper distributions of age 1+ who would be less affected physiologically.

Size anomolies tended to follow a cohort, so large age-0s results in large age 4+ fish. In earlier years this is likely driven by size-selective survival. reduced association in later years could be due to investment of resources into gonad development rather than increased growth.
