## Title:
Water masses and transport of age-0 Arctic cod and age-0 Bering flounder into the northeastern Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
arctic cod, advection, water mass
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
09/03/1989 - 07/31/1991
## Significance:
Describe the abundance and distribution of larval bering flounder in late summer from 1989-1991 in relation to the sampled water masses.  Included collection of age-0 Arctic cod throughout the NE Chukchi to investigate water mass associations.

## Notes:
Hypothesis that populations of Bering flounder might be imported and maintained by advection of larvae from the northern Bering into the Chukchi Sea.  

To investigate, they sample planktonic age-0 fish (specifically bering flounder) in relation to the physical oceanography and the distribution of age-0 Arctic cod.

Distribution of fishes in the N. Atlantic have been associated with distributions in water masses, and Saffron cod are known to vary with different current regimes.

Currents in the northeastern Chukchi Sea are dominated by flow from the Bering Sea, and the pressure head + wind results in the distribution of 3 water masses: ACW, BSW, and RCW.

Sampling was done with a bongo net, IKMT, and beam trawl (depending on year).  CTD casts were done following each net collection.

Results:
- 1989: Arctic cod were present at all stations, regardless of water mass, though most common in ACW/RCW (overlaying)
- 1990: Arctic cod were caught at all stations north of 71N
- 1991: Arctic cod were caught throughout the area, with the highest number in the Chukchi Water

Age-0 Arctic cod were foudn throughout the NE Chukchi, with the highest concentrations at stations where resident Chukchi water was present.  Climatic condition in 1989 and 1990 were similar, with northward winds resulting in an eastward displacement of the ACW. In 1991, winds were mostly to the south, pushing RCW south.

Time of hatching of Arctic cod may extend to July based on the size of fish (5-8 mm) retained in net samples in August.

There is clear association of bering flounder with ACW, however age-0 Arctic cod were more widespread.
