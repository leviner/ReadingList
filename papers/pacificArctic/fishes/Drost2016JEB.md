## Title:
Acclimation potential of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) from the rapidly warming Arctic Ocean
## Keywords:
arctic cod, metabolic, acclimation, climate change, respiration
## Geographic Coverage
Canadian Arctic
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Laboratory observations of thermal tolerance via measurements of respiration and heart rate to acute changes across various acclimation temperatures.  Shows ability to acclimate to temperatures through changes in aerobic ability and scope after 1-month of exposure.

## Notes:
Arctic cod survive in freezing conditions due to antifreeze glycoproteins, specialized kidney functions, and the ability to metabolize food down to -1.4C.  However there are few thermal physiology studies on the species.

There is no consensus from observations on the ability of A. cod to acclimate to changing climate conditions.  There is evidence that peak maximum heart rate cannot keep up with levels of acute warming, and there's evidence that newly hatched larvae will not survive after continued to exposure to temperatures >9C for more than a day.

Due to the temperature during field sampling, there is evidence of some capacity for thermal acclimation, which leads to their ability to exploit thermally stratified waters in summer.

This study aims to characterize thermal tolerance based on 3 measurements: Tc,max (upper lethal temperature), aerobic scope (the difference between minimum and maximum oxygen consumption rate), and fH (maximum heart rate).  They hypothesize that the cardio-respiratory system will acclimate at temperatures of 0.3, 3.5, and 6.5 C and that breathing rates would return to resting rates faster at cooler temperatures.

Fish were acclimated for a period of 1 month prior to testing lethal temperature, 6 month for heart rate.
- TcMax: defined by the temperature at which a fish first began to roll over during acute warming (increase of 3C/hour)
- Aerobic scope: Oxygen was measured from the DO levels in the water in an airtight respirometer
- Maximum heart rate: measured with an ecg

Metabolic respiration increased with acute warming, regardless of accumulation temperature, as did maximum heart rate.

Peak absolute aerobic scope (their ability to perform aerobic activity) increases with acclimation temperature (1 @ 1, 3.7 @ 3.5, 5.5 @ 6.5).

Oxygen extraction (respiration) and delivery to blood is temperature dependent.  Arctic cod show potential for acclimation.  Fish in 6.5 C could handle temperatures 2.2 degrees greater than the 1C acclimated fish before exhibiting signs of fatigue from acute warming.

That 6.5C acclimated fish had the greatest aerobic scope falls in line with the findings of Laurel et al., 2016 regarding the maximum growth between 5 and 9C.  These fish also exhibit fastest recovery at the warmer temperatures.  However, after acute exposure, post-exhaustion mortality is still high if temperatures do not return to acclimation temperature.  High food availability may be necessary to maintain maximum growth as described by Laurel.

Egg development is still the most critical stage of A. cod development.  Ice is likely important, for water temperature suppression, and migration/survival are likely strongly driven by water temperatures which may exceed optimal conditions for respiration and performance.

Concluding hypotheses
* Fish are friends, not food
* Don't swim towards the butt
* Dentists are bad at keeping pets
