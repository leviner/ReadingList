## Title:
The ecology of gadid fishes in the circumpolar Arctic with a special emphasis on the polar cod (Boreogadus saida)
## Keywords:
overview, habitat, distribution, food web, life cycle
## Geographic Coverage
Arctic Basin
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This is the introduction paper for the 2016 Polar Biology special issue that came out of the 2014 ESSAS annual meeting, focused on Arctic cod and their role in Arctic food webs.

## Notes:
While there's a history of research on Arctic cod, research interest has peaked in recent years with the decreasing sea ice and increase in Arctic warming, yet we still have major gaps in our knowledge, particularly of the life-cycle of these fish.  The special issue is organized in themes:

Distribution and Habitat preference
- B. saida has a pan-arctic distribution, and are by far the most abundance of the arctic gadids
- Though they have anti-freeze glycoproteins, to survive at sub-zero temperatures, they are not ice-associated species and are primarily pelagic/demersal
- Young (age-1ish) A. cod are abundance under ice throughout the central arctic as well as basin shelf breaks, likely originating on the Arctic shelves
- The vertical distribution shifts from surface (eggs) to deeper water and demersal habitat towards the end of their first years
- Saffron cod mostly inhabit coastal and brackish waters
- Possible shift in stock distribution was observed in the Russian zone of the Barents Sea, and continued monitoring through fisheries surveys would help to provide good indication of shifts in ecotone

Population genetics
- Genetic variation across the A. cod range is relatively low, with minimal variability within aggregations
- There is indication that in some regions, fjord populations have become separated from larger populations on the shelf

Life Cycle Strategies
- Maximum age of 7-8 years, reaching sexual maturity at 2-3
- **Assumed** to be a pelagic broadcast spawner, producing large floating eggs sometime between January and March
- Optimal growth conditions are between 0 and 3 degrees, 30 and 33 psu
- Favorable temperatures in warm conditions decrease time to hatching

Role in Food web
- A. cod are key secondary consumer and important trophic transfer to higher levels
- Generalist feeders, shifting to larger and more benthic prey with an ontogenetic shift in vert8ical distribution
- High dietary overlap between A. cod and other forage fish (s. cod, pollock, capelin, sandlance) suggests possible interspecific competition as temperature changes shift habitable ranges
- At warmer temperatures (>5), A. cod are outgrown by most other pacific gadids, but succeed best in colder conditions
- Poor understanding of how cod distribution changes impact predators
- Jellyfish are poorly studied as predators to cods, but are possible integral components, especially at local scales.
