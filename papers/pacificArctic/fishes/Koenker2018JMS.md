## Title:

## Significance:
Study of body and lipid condition under different temperature-food conditions, showing temperature directly impacts larval A cod and pollock, and condition varies with both temperature and food availability.

## Notes:
Nutritional condition of larval fishes can have a strong impact on mortality and serves as a way to measure animal fitness. Condition measures change with stress to varying degrees in relation to feeding. Lipids are limiting in cold water environments, and the accumulation of lipids in early life stages can vary as a result of numerous factors, most of which relate to the environment.

The quality and content of lipids reflects the condition of the fish. Here, they measure lipid content and condition under a variety of environmental conditions (temperature and productivity) to investigate how a) temperature and b) the interaction of temperature and food quality affect fish condition, and the sensitivity of such condition measures to these variations in the environment.

No significant effect of temperature was found on the morphometric conditions of either early or late-stage Arctic cod and pollock. Body density to standard length ratio generally increased across temperature. At the first-feeding phase, temperature did not significantly impact the proportion of TAG. At later stages, a significant temperature-TAG relationship existed. Arctic cod were both in a better condition at any temperature and also more sensitive to temperature changes.  Condition was maximized at 2-5 C for Arctic cod and 7 for pollock during the first-feeding stage.

Arctic cod and pollock showed no significant interactive effects of food ration and temperature at the first-feeding stage. A significant effect did exist on the relationship between body density and length, where BD:SL was greater at 5 C than at 2 C for both fish during first feeding. At both temperatures, Arctic cod receiving better food rations also had a higher BD:SL relationship.

First feeding arctic cod appear to be more sinsitive to food limitation than first-feeding pollock.
