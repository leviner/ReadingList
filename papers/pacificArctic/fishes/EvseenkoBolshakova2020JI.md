## Significance:
Morphology of scales and spiny bone plates of Boreogadus saida. The plates are only present on boreogadus and are potentially used to protect against contact with ice and reduce liminar flow around the body.

## Notes:
The adaptive morphology of arctic cod is not thoroughly studied, and one particular component is the presence of spiny bony plates which exist in addition to their ordinary cycloid scales, similar to other gadids. The aim of this paper is to describe these scale cover features and the potential adaptive/evolutionary reasons for their formation.

The scale morphology of 185 boreogadus saida and 75 arctogadus were investigated collected across the Arctic basin. Fish were examined for the presence of spiny bony plates. Scales are located next to each other with no overlap. irregularly-shaped bony plates are attached to these scales in most lateral part of the body except on the head and dorsal surface. These plates become apparent at fish sizes of 90-110 mm, with varying degree of development across regions and sizes. These spines were not present on any Arctogadus specimen.

- A cod scales are slightly different than other gadidae in that they are very small oval non-overlapping scales. In addition there are basal bony plates which have a blunt-tipped spine pointing up and back.
  - These scales differ from other teleosts as well
  - The formation of the bony plates and spines is potentially an adaptation to an active life cycle, and these can be used to alter the flow and reduce fluctuations of turbulence in the boundary layer as these fish move.
  - An additional function of the spines could be to protect the body and skin from physical damage due to ice.
  - May also lead to increased buoyancy in low salinity waters
