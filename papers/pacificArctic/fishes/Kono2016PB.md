## Title:
Distribution pattern of Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) larvae and larval fish assemblages in relation to oceanographic parameters in the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
larvae, sea ice, arctic cod,
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
06/01/2008 - 07/30/2013
## Significance:
Examination of larval A. cod in relation to the environment in 2008 and 2013.  They hypothesize two different spawning areas, one in the Gulf of Anadyr and one possibly in the Chukchi leading to distributions in similar water conditions in two separate regions.

## Notes:
Fish were collected in bongo nets, obliquely towed from 10m off bottom or upper 75m.  CTD depth profiles and SST/SSS measurements were used to  classify the water column into modes.  They determined time since sea ice retreat for each sampling station using SSM/I SIC.  Larval fish abundances were log transformed for cluster analysis.

Arctic cod made up 35% of the fish abundance, followed by sand lance (27%), then flounders/halibuts.  The highest abundance regions were in the NE Chukchi sea:
- SST: .31-5.39
- Ftemp: -1.75 - 5.75
- Fsal: 31.3 - 32.8
- SSS: 29 - 32.5
- days since ice retreat: 6-66

Arctic cod size was positively correlated with temperature, negatively correlated with salinity.  Arctic cod were an indicator species of the functional group of cold/saline waters both south of ST. Lawrence and north of 70N.  IN the south, this is indicative of Anadyr waters, while in the north it is "winter water"
