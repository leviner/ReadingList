## Title:
Pre-winter distribution and habitat characteristics of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) in southeastern Beaufort Sea
## Keywords:
arctic cod, migration, shelf break
## Geographic Coverage
Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
10/18/2003 - 11/20/2003
## Significance:
Investigate the distribution of age-0 and age-1+ aggregations of Arctic cod in the Canadian Beaufort in early Winter.

## Notes:
Adult polar cod feed primarily on late stages of pelagic zooplankton, in the Beaufort commonly C. glacialis, C. hyperboreus, and Metridia longa.  Juveniles preferentially feed on eggs and nauplii rather than adult stages.

Age-0 fish are found in the upper 75m or so of the water column while aggregations of age-1+ occur at depth along the shelf break.  Over winter the adults remain at depth, and in May begin to migrate up towards the surface and form smaller dense schools throughout the water column, likely to follow the ontogenetic migration (coming out of diapause) of their copepod prey.

The overwintering aggregations are believed to form from biophysical coupling of:
- conditioning during early winter spawning
- passive advection
- depth keeping behavior to reduce predation

Spent fish would likely drift in along-slope currents until retained by some topographical feature.

"SV120–38 of juveniles and adult swimbladdered fish generally ranges from –10 dB to 5 dB (Kang et al. 2002; Logerwell and Wilson 2004; Murase et al. 2009), while the SV120–38 of copepods and large amphipods, dominating the local zoo- plankton, is generally[5 dB (Madureira et al. 1993; Kang et al. 2002; Murase et al. 2009; Simard and Sourisseau 2009). To avoid noisy estimates and ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio, the SV120–38 was computed using a threshold of –90 dB at both frequencies. SV120–38 ranging from –10 to 5 dB was considered as polar cod"

Used Echoview fish tracking to calculate mean TS for tracked animal.

Epipelagic layer ichthyoplankton was 88.5% age=0 Arctic cod.  A. cod were vertically distributed in two layers: the epipelagic layer and a mesopelagic layer between 200-400 meters, with the highest densities over areas with a bottom depth <600m and > 150m.

There was no correlation between the areal biomasses of the two layers, so they are decoupled in distribution.

Age-0 fishes (epipelagic layer) was mostly in the Polar Mixed Layer (>-1.4C and <32.5 PSU).  Mesopelagic layer of adults was mostly in Pacific halociline and atlantic layer waters (high salinities, temperature between -1.4 and .5).

- Epipelagic mean TS: -56.7 corresponding to 4.4cm pollock (Parker-Stetter 2011 TS-length)
- Mesopelagic TS modes: -49.25 to -41.25 (12-28cm)

Age-0 fish associated with warm and low-salinity water, while adults are associated with warm and salty water at depth.  Small juveniles likely delay their movement to depth until the surface waters become too cold.

In December is when it appears the fish make their descent.

Possible mechanisms for aggregation:
- Passive transported
- active migration: spawning to feeding ground migration of fish, however since fish were observed at both Mackenzie shelf break and Amundsen without major changes in biomass, this is unlikely the same population.
  - their swimming ability in cold water might be reduced
  - their movement could vary daily

Abrupt topographies can be favorable feeding locations due to advective concentration of zooplankton, polar cod likely increase their possibility of finding higher concentrations of copepod prey at depth along the shelf break.  This is also true for A. cod predators (Belugas concentrate along the slope).

Concluding hypotheses
* Evidence of depth segregation of size classes through TS observations
* Dense aggregations do not form until after ice is consolidated
