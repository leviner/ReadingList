## Title:
Polar cod in jeopardy under the retreating Arctic sea ice
## Keywords:
climate, biophysical, dispersal, arctic cod, ice
## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Backtracking modelling of age-0 polar cod dispersal, indicating that recruitment is largely correlated with ice presence and summer surface temperatures.

## Notes:
With increasing warming, the border between Arctic and Boreal biomes is moving north. Arctic/polar cod are a keystone species in the Barents Sea Arctic ecosystem. The spatial distribution of age-0 arctic cod has varied significantly over the period they've been monitored in the region suggesting high variability in recruitment. It is hypothesized that this may be impacted by the observed variability in ice cover.

They use a back-track larval drift model to locate potential under ice spawning locations from observed age-0 arctic cod in summer. This is simulated over 28 spawning seasons from 1990-2017 and compared with catches from surveys.

In summary, they found a positive relationship between year class and ice cover, and a negative relationship with maximum summer temperature.

There are two likely spawning region, with interannual variability of the central location within in region.

They suggest two mechanisms driving recruitment variability:
- Presnece/absence of ice leads to match/mismatch with copepod nauplii when the timing of the spring bloom is driven by the presence of sea ice.
- High summer temperatures may push larvae beyond thermal thresholds.

Alternate spawning areas or dispersal pathways may begin to occur in the northern Barents where ice is still prevalent, and the advection in the surface layer is mostly wind driven.
