## Notes:
Climate change in the Arctic and subarctic can change the spatio-temporal dynamics through changes in water inputs and movement, altering dispersal pathways. Early life stage survival depends on the environment in particular the potential to be advected into/across unsuitable habitats. The specific gravity of these eggs and larvae controls the vertical distribution and thus the conditions they are exposed to.

Here, they conduct lab studies to compare the buoyancy and acute salinity of the four dominant north pacific gadid species to test if 1) egg densities for arctic cod match salinities for surface development while pollock for midwater, 2) polar and saffron cod are better suited for abrupt changes in salinity.

Eggs were collected from the AFSC broodstock. Egg and larval specific gravities/densities were determined based on sinking rate at fixed temperature and salinities. Salinity tolerances were tested by putting larvae in beakers of 0,1,2,3,5,ambient, and 35 psu. Preliminary tests of 15 PSU showed no impact hence the lower values. Salinity tolerance was modeled as separate logistic regressions split at 11 psu. Model values from PAROMS were used to identify surface conditions and identify where you would expect positive/negative egg buoyancies based on results.

Arctic cod eggs were more buyant than pollock, and both were more buoyant than pacific cod, with significant density differences among the species prior to hatch. Pacific cod eggs appear to become more buoyant as they develop. As Larvae, pollock and arctic cod buoyancy was identical and positively buoyant. Pcod and saffron cod were also similar and negatively buoyant, though less so than as eggs.

Density significantly changed in Arctic cod from late egg to 2-week post-hatch. Densities varied significantly across batches, however survival was lower with eggs having densities outside of the "middle" range. The inclusion/removal of these batches did not change the significance of the results.

The best fitting models for salinity tolerance were those that considered each species or species and development stage. Salinity tolerance was lost at later development for Acod and pollock, though this was not significant for Acod.at 0-3 weeks post hatch, tolerance was similar, where there was low survival at 0, rapidly increasing to 100% at 5 psu. By 6 wph, this declined, with 100% mortality up to 3 psu. Arctic and saffron cod exhibited similar responses, with 100% survival by 5, and slight reduction at the highest values.

Spatially, Arctic cod eggs were more buoyant than the surface waters in most of the bering/chukchi/beaufort except in the region of direct input from the yukon river. Pollock were positively buoyant on the outer but negatively buyant on the inner and middle shelves.

Conclusions
- Arctic cod eggs would be retained under sea ice if ice is present at the time of spawning
- Larval densities converge post-hatch, and for polar cod are similar to the late egg stages
- Changes in ertical position in the water column are less likely to be the result of density and more so swimming ability and behavioral cues
- Batch variation could be the result of maternal influence
- Arctic species were more salinity tolerant than subarctic species and survived short-term exposure to low/no salinity environments, and egg salinities may be more sensitive to salinities up to ~15 PSU
- Eggs near the surface on the shelf could mean increased ice exposure, which could be lethal for species such as pollock, or increased light exposure for Acod in low ice conditions resulting in increased predation or UV damage.
