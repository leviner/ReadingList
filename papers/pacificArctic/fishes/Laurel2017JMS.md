## Significance:
Laboratory experiments of the effect of temperature on growth rates in age-0 and age-1 Arctic cod.  Optimal temperature decreases with size, and growth is strongly dependent on both environmental temperature and size.  Source of L-W regressions and growth rates for juvenile fishes.

## Notes:
Fish have a specific temperature where baseline metabolic costs are efficient and maximize the energy allocation for growth.  As fish age, this temperature optima may change, and energy allocation may shift from growth towards reproduction.

Here, they measure the effects of temperature and fish size on growth rate of A. cod in the lab to addres:
1. How much does growth potential change with size?
2. Does the optimal temperature for growth remain constant across the age-0 and age-1 period?

Age 1 fish were collected in the Beaufort using fyke nets nearshore, age-0 fish were reared from a group of A. cod collected in 2012 and raised in Newport Or lab.  They were reared at 2-3C, and took approx. 7 months to reach 35 - 50mm in length from fertilization.

Fish were acclimated to their temperature treatments for 2 weeks before growth rates were monitored.  Age-0 fish only were tested up to 12C as the fish could not survive at 16C.  Specific growth rates were determined as a function of instantaneous growth as calculated from weights.

Arctic cod survived at all temperatures except 16C, where they died after 4 weeks of exposure.  There was a significant effect of the age x temperature interaction.  The individual age models explained more than 90% of the growth variance.  It was impossible to tell whether these differences were due to age or size since there was no age-size overlap.  Findings indicate that temperature and size interact to explain growth, most clearly demonstrated in age-specific models, though clear in combined size and temperature models.

Growth rates typically decrease with body size and age.  A. cod mature relatively early and have a small maximum length.  Optimal temperature decreased with size, consistent with other species.  The higher optimal temperature of the smaller fish may be an adaptation to maximize growth during the first summer before overwintering in cooler, deeper water, and the temperature change with age may improve survival in Arctic.

From the rearing of the age-0 fish, there appears to be little survival of the eggs at temperatures greater than 5C, with an increased tolerance up to 9C during feeding stage of larvae.  In the Beaufort and Chukchi, A. cod are unlikely to experience major temperature fluctuations until later in summer when freshwater input drives high variability in temperature, however the fish are already 15-30mm in length at this point.

A. cod show strong age-specific associations with temperature in the field, support this decreasing optimal thermal temperature as they age.  However it is important to note the role of food and physical conditions (light) in growth and habitat selection.  Age-0 fish in the CHukchi may be associated with cooler waters for increased visual predation ability.
