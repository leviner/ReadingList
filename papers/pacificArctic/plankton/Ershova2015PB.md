## Title:
Inter-annual variability of summer mesozooplankton communities of the western Chukchi Sea: 2004â€“2012
## Keywords:
pelagic ecosystems, assemblages, water mass, zooplankton
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
08/04/2004 - 09/24/2012
## Significance:
Description of the zooplankton community in relation to water masses during 4 years of the RUSALCA survey program.  Community structure strongly correlated with bottom temperature.

## Notes:
The Chukchi sea ecosystem, which is "tuned" for ice, is now experiencing changes in ice cover.  Two hypotheses have been presented:
- Increased primary production driven by an increase in open water area
- Nutrient limitation will ultimately restrict production, with limited to no increase

Shifts from diatom dominated to picoplankton dominated communities have already been recorded, due to warming and ice reduction, pointing towards a regime shift. "A protracted ice-free summer period within the chukchi could potentially benefit advected  Pacific zooplankton species, permitting them to play a larger role in the summer planktonic communities and facilitate a northward shift of their ranges, likely at the expense of 'resident' Arctic species".

Here, they describe the summer zooplankton communities of the western Chukchi, focusing on the Russian side, with data from the RUSALCA program.

Data were collected with vertically hauled ring nets or bongo nets, integrating the entire water column.  Water mass identification was done in 3 layers: surface (0-10), bottom (10m above seafloor), and midwater (10 from surface to 10 above bottom).  Only surface and bottom were used for clusters, and while increasing the bin size resulted in similar clustering, it decreased the correlations with biology.  Midwater layer was found to be highly correlated and was not included.

Water mass clustered into 11 groups, which matched six water mass types/classifications.  In 2004 and 2012, zooplankton abundances were ~3000 ind/m3, while in 2009 and 2010, it was almost 3 times higher (~8000 ind/m3), driven by high abundances of small copepods.  The majority of species were advected subarctic pacific species.  Copepods dominated both abundance (small cops) and biomass (c. glacialis).  Large copepods dominated the BS water, declining towards the siberian coast.  Small cops were abundant everywhere, and most abundant near the coasts.  Hydrozoa were common within the coastal freshwater masses.

In cluster analysis, the stations mostly separated by year.  
- The ACW communities were the easiest to recognize by the presence of warmer-water euryhaline (wide salinity range) taxa.  
- Bering Sea communities were mostly shelf species, such as pseudocalanus, c. glacialis, and other oceanic copepods.
- Winter water community had a number of the Bering sea species, but lower abundance of copepods, particularly c. glacialis, and the presence of a few arctic species of hydrozoa, copepod, and amphipod
- Siberian coastal water was similar to chukchi water but with less pacific species, and very few large copepods.

C. glacialis stage differed between water masses, with C5 copepodites in the BS/AW, but C1-C4 dominant in the coastal waters.  The very low numbers of the copepod C. glacialis in the SCW and resident Chukchi communities strongly suggest that most of the C. glacialis population in the shallow Chukchi Sea was advected from the Bering Sea rather than the Arctic basins, and thus was not composed of resident individuals. There is likely two populations, dominated by a pacific population in the offshore waters of CIV-CV, and an Arctic population of CI-CIII in the WW and Siberian waters.

Bottom temperature appeared to be the most significantly correlated to community structure.

Detectable seasonal change can happen in a matter of weeks.  Fronts of different water masses can can replace the community type over these relatively short timescales.  Interannual variability among cruises may be due to timing of survey.  Extremely high abundances of chaetognaths in the september cruises may indicate a signal from summer to autumn community structure.

Colder years with later ice retreat tend to benefit the populations of larger copepods, which may reflect the regimes of the Bering Sea in similar years. There doesn't seem to be changes in smaller copepod abundances, possibly due to the ability of smaller species to be more responsive to local conditions.

These observations indicate that the environment is highly variable, and it would require multiple years of maintained altered conditions to alter the community structure.  WHile longer warm periods may allow more pacific species to enter, the region is still seasonally ice covered and advected species are unlikely to establish permanent populations to expand their range.
