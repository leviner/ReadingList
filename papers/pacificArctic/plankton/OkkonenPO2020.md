## Title:
Krill diel vertical migration: A diagnostic for variability of wind forcing over the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
## Keywords:
upwelling, winds, zooplankton, adcp
## Geographic Coverage
Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
08/01/2009 - 08/01/2015
## Significance:
Use of ADCPs to measure intensity of DVM in krill and correlate with wind and upwelling conditions in the western Beaufort.

## Notes:
Krill in the area of Utqiagvik typically originate in the Bering Sea. Interannual variability in Chukchi Sea winds can be used to describe interannual variability in autumn krill populations.

Krill trap: easterly upwelling winds move krill from the Beaufort slope onto the shelf.  When upwelling winds relax, the krill are retained on the western Beaufort shelf where the northern flow out of Chukchi converge with the westward-flowing shelf currents. Whale presence both confirms the presence of the krill trap and indicates a potential delay.

Wind-krill relationship indicates that krill can be used to estimate local and regional scale winds. Using ADCP data, you can identify krill vs other particulate based on DVM behavior, and thus an index of DVM can be used to identify wind regimes.

NCEP daily surface wind reanalysis product was used for met data. 307 kHz ADCPs were deployed from 2009 to 2015. An index of DVM (DVMI) was extracted from the ADCP echo intensity measurements based on the intensity of scattering matching an expected kernel of DVM scattering.

Positive anomalies in DVMI are predicated on the occurrence of constant southerly winds over the Chukchi. Negative krill trap (low DVMI) conditions are associated with weak winds over the Chukchi and strong easterlies.

Multiyear DVM record encodes the amplitude of the wind forcing regimes, and thus the krill availability for bowhead whale foraging. One-day lag response of DVMI agrees well with upwelling conditions. It appears that krill-trap state DVMIs have higher intensity than upwelling-state DVMIs.

The largest DVMIs occured in years when mean winds in mid-summer across the Chukchi were to the south. This reflects other models which show that under southerly winds, pacific water aggregates near Utqiagvik.

The biomass of krill can be driven by both the recruitment in the bering and the time of transport and thus the developmental stage of krill when they arrive.  "The interdependencies of variability in recruitment, in advective pathways, and in dominant life stages are beyond the scope of the present analysis yet the observed associations pose intriguing questions and highlight the potential importance of krill dynamics in the up- stream source region (Bering Sea)"

There is an expected increase in easterly winds over the Beaufort shelf, which would possibly reduce the biomass available for marine mammal foraging.
