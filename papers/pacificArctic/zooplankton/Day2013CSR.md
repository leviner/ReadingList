## Title:
The offshore northeastern Chukchi Sea, Alaska: A complex high-latitude ecosystem
## Keywords:
community, ecosystem, hanna shoal
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
07/01/2008 - 10/30/2010
## Significance:
Synthesis of the findings from the Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program from 2008-2010 at three regions of oil exploration interest near Hanna Shoal.

## Notes:
Conducted an interdisciplinary study in three regions of interest for oil exploration in the northeastern Chukchi just southwest of Hannah Shoal.  Data was collected from shipboard measurements with fixed and random station sampling, and acoustic moorings.

Physical Oceanography
- Bering Sea Water spread east from the central channel, observed in each year.
- Bottom water temperatures can be dramatically different across space

Nutrients
- Nutrients were stripped out of the upper water column, mostly present below the pycnocline in Winter Water
- Increase at depth either due to remineralization or possibly upwelling
- The SCM was just at/below the pycnocline
- Aragonite saturation state was lowest at ~.7 in september/october at some stations, having decreased over the course of the open water season

Zooplankton
- Copepods made up the majority of the biomass, though the compositoin of the community varied spatially
- Planktonic communities were found to change seasonally, particularly in relation to changing local temperatures.
- COmmunity composition shifts from early summer to late summer, then back to early summer composition in fall.

Benthic community abundance and biomass varied by year and site.

Demersal fish community
- combination of circumpolar and subarctic species
- highest densities and richness in area of warm bottom temperatures

Seabirds and marine mammals
- Seabird are a mix of holoarctic, beringian, palearctic, and australasian migratory
- In years of BSW extension, zooplankton-feeding seabirds are more prevalent
- Ice and water mass influence the distribution and abundance of pinnipeds
- In the absence of ice, it appears that walrus were swimming to feed at Hanna shoal from coastal haulout locations

Summary: two distinct ecosystems in the NE Chukchi; pelagic and benthic
- The pelagic dominated ecosystem is a reflection of the BSW, mostly in the central channel where warm moderate nutrient water exists, with more oceanic zooplankton and a higher grazing (trophic transfer) capacity, plus higher density and species richness of demersal fishes.
- Benthic community reflects melt water and winter water impacts, with low grazing and high export.  This is clear in the distinction of domains of the zooplankton community.
- Interannual differences in zooplankton and seabirds are attributed to BSW/MW variability, with spatial differences reflecting the environmental properties.
- Production is low in the chukchi, though there is high energy transfer and advection from other carbon sources.  
- Low abundance and small size of demersal fishes, particularly relative to near shore communities
- "tremendous ecological variation in a small area"

"Pelagic communities in the northeastern Chukchi Sea are poorly developed and depend primarily on the flow of zooplankton from areas farther south"
