## Significance:
Year-round observations of C. hyperboreus growth and reproduction in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.  Hypothesize top-down control of the C. hyperboreus population by other omnivore species (M. longa, C. glacialis), increased by extended ice-free periods.

## Notes:
Calanus hyperboreus is the main herbivore along the shelf margins of the Arctic Ocean.  When it accumulates enough lipids, it performs a long-range migration to diapause for up to 10 months between several hundreds to thousands of meters depth.  Lipids are mostly stored as wax esters in oil sacs, comprised of long-chained fatty acids.  Reproduction in summer is timed so that offspring can reach CIII-adult stage in order to successfully overwinter the next year.  Here, they document the life cycle by sampling throughout the winter over 2 freeze-in events.

Samples were collected suing a multinet and larger frame net, and live zooplankton were kept for egg reproduction experiments and carbon content measurements.

Results
- Ice algae begins to increase in concentration in mid-March, with flourescence at 30m depth beginning in May/June (depending on year).
- Integrated copepodite and adult females were fairly stable over the course of the year, with little seasonal variability except for peaks in early copepodite stages in May.  The main overwintering stages were CIV and adult females. The proportion of CV decreased over the course of the winter.  By mid July, there were no more CI-CII
- Reproduction occurs from mid-January to mid-April before sizeable chl concentrations were observed.
  - Egg production was highly variable, between 7-65 eggs per day, with clutch sizes ranging from 26 to 195 eggs.  Maximum clutches were observed in February to mid-March
  - Daily egg production increases rapidly between early January and February, remaining high until early April.
  - Nauplii became most abundant in the water column around early March (N1-N3), which decreased dramatically in April.
- M. longa and c. glacialis are the most common predators of eggs/nauplii locally.

Discussion
- Overwintering C. hyperboreus populations remain stable when it is mostly CIV copepodites and adults.  They propose a 2-3 years life cycle in the region.
- Females were feeding on ice algae before switching to phytoplankton bloom where they were able to quickly fill their lipid reserves.  Downward migration begins in July, even with the strong SCM.  CII-CIV appear to remain within the SCM to continue feeding into late summer before migrating.
- CI recruitment coincided with a large phytoplankton bloom in May
- Eggs and nauplii float toward the surface, developing in April when peak ice algae blooming begins.

They propose top-down control of the hyperboreaus population:
- A higher egg accumulation is expected then occured in the surface waters based on the egg production of the females, and the deficit may be due to predation
- High population reduction between egg and nauplii, indicating high mortality.  

Poor egg viability is also a possibility.  M. longa are known to feed on eggs and nauplii of hyperboreus, with negative relationships between the populations.  They conclude that "abundant omnivores" (longa, glacialis) in favorable early ice melt conditions had high predation on the hyperboreus population.
