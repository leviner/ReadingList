## Significance:
Observations of surface warming trends across the arctic and the association with the Arctic Oscilation.

## Notes:
The arctic ocean is warming due to increase in warmer subducting waters into the deeper basin. Surface waters and sea ice are also warming, and here they investigate the histroical trend in surface water heaing in summer.

Used data from the world ocean datatabase between 60N and 90N to find SST and ocean heat content (OHC) which is the integrated heat content from surface to 100m or bottom. Trends were computed on 200km gridding using a simple linear regression. SST was determined from a satellite monthly mean product.

The Arctic oscillation (AO) periods produce more distinct trends over the period of 1930-1995. Most regions cool during AO- and warm during AO+. Ice retreat in the east siberian sea appears to be earllier during AO+ as well, likely driven by increasing warm southerly winds. Along with a reduction of the beaufort gyre, there is less ice converging in the western pacific arctic.

In the Paciic arctic overall, there is weak increase in SST associated with AO+, but clear warming of the OHC, likely the result of the subsurface heat input from the Pacific. low correlation in recent years may be due to sea ice, where the western Beaufort receives more sea ice in AO-, with more summer ice and cooler summer SSTs. Thinner/thicker sea ice at the beginning of the melt season leads to warmer/cooler summer ssts.

Recent warming is particularly pronounced in the Bering and Chukchi which show now trend until the early 2000s.

Overall, sea ice advection and summertime open water duration are likely the most important factor influencing SST in the western arctic, though the roles in recent years of increased warming are unclear.
