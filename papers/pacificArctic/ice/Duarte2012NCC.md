Discussion of the causes and impacts of climate change in the Arctic.

## Notes:
In the Arctic, the rate of climate change is now faster than ecosystems can naturally adapt, and human activities and health are being compromised.  

Here, the authors argue that the debate over the definiteion of a tipping point is distracting from the need to develop early warning indicators of change and addressing the causes and impacts.

Warming in the Arctic is proceeding at 3 times the global average over the last decade, and loss of sea ice has been linked to extreme cold winters in Europe.  Near complete loss of sea ice in summer is predicted for mid-century and has implications for the jet stream and storm tracks in the northern hemisphere.

Shrinkage of sea ice has proceeded faster than predicted.  

The authors argue that a tipping point does not have to be a point of no return, though difficult to reverse, and this confusion is distracting from the need for action.

The recovery of ice to full extent in winter does not imply recovery, since this also is dependent on the thickness of ice, which show a dramatic decrease in the sea ice volume in recent decades, and thus the variability in ice extent has increased as first-year ice (and hence more prone to melt in summer) dominates.

Reduced sea ice is expected to change the size and species composition of plankton in an irreversible manner, with ramifications for higher trophic levels and air-sea carbon exchange.

A systematic effort should be made to look for signs of further change.  Time series of ecology are patchy at best, though the maintenance of biological observations is important to develop adaptive strategies.

The authors suggest immediate mitigation of radiative forcing agents.
