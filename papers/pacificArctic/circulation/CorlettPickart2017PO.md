## Significance:
The authors describe the observation of a westward flow that advects a significant portion of Pacific-origin water, predominantly winter water, westward along the slope, as well as a weaker shelfbreak jet moving shallower water to the east.

## Notes:
While there are three primary channels for pacific water across the Chukchi shelf (the Alaskan coastal current, Central channel, and northwest flow towards Herald canyon and Long Strait), there is now a more detailed understanding that particularly in the northeast Chukchi, there are more small filaments that influence the speed and timing of winter water advection across the shelf.

Some portion of the Pacific water ends up in the shelfbreak jet that flows east and along the Beaufort sea, coming out of barrow canyon, but there is also a portion of water moving out of Herald canyon, doing the same thing acorss the Chukchi shelf.  But this is only a small portion of the water (.8 to 1.1 Sv) entering the strait, so there must be more outflow, since much of the central channel/Heral canyon flow ends up being forced back towards the east.  The Beaufort jet is too small to include these budgets.

Series of surveys across the shelf slope over 12 years, from the Russian border to Bearrow canyon.

Remnant winter water makes up nearly half of the Chukchi slope water, with Atlantic water making up most of the water at depth (>150m).

The shelf slope current is mostly RWW, with a large portion of meltwater.  There is some seasonality, with BSW and ACW increasing from June to October then decreasing again.  There is a strong westward flow in october, likely driven by winds, with the strongest easterlies.  This is likely the same reason the shelfbreak jet slows down or even reverses during this period.

The slope current even exists during westerlies.

There was an increase in transport over the time series, attributed by the authors to the increase in zonal winds.

The current is from surface to ~125m, though when weak is confined to the top 40m.

A mass budget can be determined for the barrow canyon water.



Concluding hypotheses
* The slope current is largely wind driven, but even under weak/reversed conditions still carries a bulk of the Chukchi outflow water west
* The slope current emanates from Barrow Canyon, based on the high proportion of Pacific summer water and remnant winter water.
