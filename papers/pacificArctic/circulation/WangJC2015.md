## Title:
Historical changes in the Beaufort-Chukchi-Bering Seas surface winds and waves, 1971-2013
## Keywords:
climate variability, trends, wind, circulation
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Analysis of historical trends in wind speed and surface waves in the PAR to determine long term trends in waves, showing increases in wave height and period.

## Notes:
Decreasing sea ice extent increases potential wind-wave generation as exposed surface increases. Under reduced sea ice, the increase in wave action could acta as a feedback mechanism further reducing ice.

Few studies have looked at long term trends because of lack of wave data, however reanalysis data of wave height and wind speed has been used to create a extended time series from 1971 to 2013.

During this period, during open water in July-September, wave data increases, so each month was analyzed separately. There was significant change in the climates of wind speed between the period of 1970-1971 and 1992-2013. There was an increasing trend during all 3 months, with an increase of .1 to .3% per year.

Changes in local wind cannot alone explain the changes in waves, indicating that swells and other non-local forcings (sea ice) likely are the drivers. Increased in wave period and height result in an increase in total wave energy which is a mechanism for accelerating the breakup of sea ice.
