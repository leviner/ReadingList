## Title:
A comparison between late summer 2012 and 2013 water masses, macronutrients, and phytoplankton standing crops in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas
## Keywords:
water mass, wind, ice melt, coastal current, nutrients
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
08/07/2012 - 09/25/2013
## Significance:
This paper presents an overview of the physical, chemical, and phytoplankton observations as they relate to winds, flow, and ice conditions as observed during the 2012 and 2013 Arctic EIS program.  First set of "physics to fish" observations covering the whole region.

## Notes:
Objective: "...document and account for the observed hydrographic and biological dis- tributions by characterizing horizontal and vertical variations of the thermohaline, macronutrient and Chla distributions, their year-to-year differences and their co-variability."

The Bering an Chukchi sea are fed by the 1-1.2 Sv flow of water through Bering Strait during summer and .5-.6Sv during winter.  Water flowing across the Chukchi shelf heads along one of three major conduits: Herald Canyon (West), Barrow Canyon (East), and the Central Channel (mid-shelf).

Primary flow forcing on the shallow shelf is wind.  Tidal forcings are relatively small (~5cm/s) across the shelf except in Kotzebue and near Wrangel Island.  

Water from the Bering enters as three main water masses:
- Anadyr Water (AW): relatively saline, cold, nutrient rich water that circumscribes the Gulf of Anadyr into the Northe Bering before entering the Strait.  High nutrient builds in the Chirikov Basin, powered mostly by the Pacific-Arctic pressure field
- Alaska Coastal Water (ACW): low surface nutrients, chlorophyll, and phytoplankton productivity, specifically following the spring bloom, and in stratified late-summer in the Chukchi, can lead to a deep chl max, much stronger than surface levels.  Coastal production is sparked by outflow or ice melt.
- Bering Shelf Water (BSW)

Strong benthic-pelagic coupling due to water column primary production that exceeds grazing capacity.

The length of time to transition from ice-free to ice-covered (and vice-a-versa) is "potentially important physically and biologically"

Strongly contrasting wind fields between 2012 and 2013 surveys.  2012: southwesterly winds at the beginning of the survey, changing to northeasterly winds over the Chukchi, 2013: Low pressure zone was just hanging over the Chukchi, promoting easterly flow

August 2012 winds were 1m/s higher than 2013, and eastward currents directing outflow at Barrow Canyon.

Water masses - ACW water extended further north in 2012 along the coast, with more BCWW dominating the northern Chukchi (and extending further south ~70N) in 2013.  The ACC was mostly absent during the 20133 cruise in the HFR dataset.  Ledyard Bay (from satellite imagery) appears to be an area where flow stalls and recirculates, deflecting offshore.

Vertical stratification was weak both years, coastal waters near LB were warmer in 2013, but waters near the strait (Bering Sea) were fresher in 2012.

Discussion:
Though wind was stronger in 2012, they were directed south in 2013, leading to a shutdown of the ACC near LB
Phytoplankton were smaller in 2012 that influenced the zooplankton community.  Larger phytoplankton dominated the Hannah Shoal community in 2013, possibly caused by extent of CSWW and MW

2012, very low Bering Strait transport, 2013 was realtively high.  Stronger flow did not correlate with an increase in nutrient flux (2013 was lower nutrient concentrations)

Yukon river outflow conforms to wind driven circulation, where water may be stored in Norton Sound.

Concluding hypotheses
* Phytoplankton community can be attributed to water mass distributions and their nutrient loads,
* Not clear if an increase in Bering Strait transport would lead to an increase in nutrient transport
* 2013, the shelf was flooded with ice melt, and coastal water was further offshore in the south
