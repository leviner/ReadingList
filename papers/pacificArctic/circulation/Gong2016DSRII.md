## Significance:
Detection of a dense Chukchi Sea Water and the description of possible sources due to formation relating tot he modification of water masses as they are transported across the NE Chukchi Shelf via observation during early summer.

## Notes:
The halocline of the western Arctic is set by properties of the water transported across the shelf.  The inflow and processes modifying the water can lead to basin-scale changes in the Arctic density structure.

Cold Pacific Winter Water formed by cooling and brine rejection, is further modified as it moves north on the shelf, influenced by polynyas and variability in the winter water transport at Bering Strait.

Mean flushing time of the shelf can be estimated from the volume of PWW and the Bering Strait transport in spring/summer.  PWW can fully drain from the shelf in about 5 months.  

The warm portion of the halocline is of Pacific origin as summer water.  In the basin, this results in a temperature max of the water column at 10-20m depth, then warming again at about 50m from the Chukchi summer water.

"It is not yet clear how or where these waters obtain their final temperature/salinity characteristics, and if [they] change from year to year"

In the northern shelf, they found warm and salty water, the same temperature as the CSW but much more dense.  There are two possibilities:
1. This water was advected from the Bering in this form
2. The watermass was formed locally

The light density class of water masses, comprised mostly of CSW, was found everywhere in 2010.  The heavier density class was confined to the northeast, made mostly of newly ventilated and remnant winter water, likely moving slowly through the central channel.

Dense Chukchi Summer Water (DCSW) was only found near Icy Cape and within Barrow Canyon, suggesting either a patch followed the ACC or was formed locally.

No DCSW was detected in Bering STrait, but there is evidence of downstream transport north of Icy Cape in mooring data collected in August.  The lack of any measurement of DCSW at Bering Strait, together with the presence of DCSW in the shelfbreak jet suggest that this water mass is formed locally in the Chukchi Sea.  The possible mechanisms are:
- Mixing between summer and winter water masses
- heating of the winter water masses via air-sea interaction and solar radiation

DCSW is on the mixing line between the ACW and PWW.  While the eddy diffusion rate required for this mixing is high, it is not unreasonable for the highly energetic ACC.  However, the potential for this mixing occurs every year, yet DCSW is not observed annually.

Warming of salty PWW via surface radiation could lead to DCSW formation.  Before summer water enters in spring, the entire shelf is covered in PWW.  If ice opening occurs before the PWW is displaced, solar heating could modify it.  Satellite observations in 2010 show a possible scenario.  In June 2010, much of the shelf was still ice-covered, indicating that transport was delayed.  PWW in the Chukchi therefore had a chance to warm prior to being displaced.  The time of exposure required for the possible 4C heating is only 16 days.

There is significant interannual variability in the occurence of DCSW.  In 2004 and 2010 however, not only was the water mass detected, but a coastal polynya occured.  Strong winds from the northeast drive polynya formation, conducive for DCSW formation.

DCSW heat transport is comparable to the negative heat transport draining into the basin from the PWW, and in certain years will counterbalance the PWW cooling.  During these years of DCSW formation, cooling of the western Arctic halocline may be significantly offset.
