## Title:
Increases in the Pacific inflow to the Arctic from 1990 to 2015, and insights into seasonal trends and driving mechanisms from year-round Bering Strait mooring data
## Keywords:
seasonal variations, heat, currents, freshwater
## Geographic Coverage
Bering Strait, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
01/01/1990 - 12/31/2016
## Significance:
Trends of transport at Bering Strait from continuous measurements from 19990 - 2016.  Transport increase of .01-.02 Sv/year, driven by changes in the pressure head.

## Notes:
Pacific Arctic Region:
- 1/3 of all of the freshwater entering the arctic
- sets up near surface stratification in 1/2 of the arctic ocean
- supplies cold halocline, buffering sea ice and the alaskan coastal water

The water properties of the Chukchi Sea are set by the water properties through Bering Strait.
- Residence time is a function of volume transport @ the Strait
- heat flux through the strait may explain 68% of the variance in timing of sea ice retrea
- volume transport has increased
  - earlier warming corresponding to increase in heat and freshwater

Since 1990, with minimal interruption, there have been year-round measurements of Bering Strait. Little progress has been made on what leads to the interannual change.  The goal is to identify the source of the increase in transport.  Previous work found a decrease in SSH of the Arctic due to westward winds over the E. siberian pulls water north.  Main goal of this work is to quantify changes over the 25 year period of observations.

- Annual mean velocity and volume transport
  - Velocity and volume continue to increase
  - no significant trend at A4 (in the ACC)
  - from 2001 to 2014, volume has almost doubled
  - 2014 peak annual mean transport was +-28 cm/s, compared with 18 cm/s in 2001
  - With hourly variability ranging from -100 to 130 cm/s
  - Significant increase in the occurence of flow speeds > 40 cm/s, with a significant decrease in speeds <40cm/s
  - High transport years appear to be due to more connsistent strong northward flow events
  - There was a "step" in the warming/regime, occurring in 2002, since the annual temperatures have been > the mean
- Annual mean temp and salinity
  - Annual mean temperature and salinity show significant trends
  - SST had no trend over the period
- Timing of warm waters
  - .9 (+-.8) trend in earlier arrival of warm waters, weakened from 2012 extreme low
- Freshwater and heat Increases
  - Heat and FW fluxes increased due to dependence on transport
  - despite being 1/10 of the Fram strait flow, the ACC is 1/3 of the variability of heat in the Arctic basin
  - ACC shows no discernable trends in volume, temp, or arrival of the entire time series
- Inter-mooring correlations
  - Annual mean velocities are well correlated between mooring stations
  - A3 (north of the strait) is a useful combo of A1 and A2 (the two in the strait)
  - ACC freshening is highly correlated to temperature
  - Correlations between velocity and temperature indicate high flow occurs in warm years (or that warm years result from high flow)

Seasonality
- Salinity: in late winter has more negative trends, with a mid-winter freshening of 1 psu
  - This is most likely due to a reduction in sea ice (volume)
  -  Late spring waters are likely to most resemble the source
    - winter is ice influenced (brine rejection)
    - summer is river influenced (high freshwater inputs)
    - Decrease of salinity in winter decreases the annual range of salinity
- Temperature: Small but significant warming and trends in the freezing temperature
  - Larger trends in May/June which match the earlier arrival of warm water
  - May to october are well correlated with the annual mean temperature
  - Summer trends of .05C/year, or 1C over the 25 year record
- Transport: Greatest trends in transport occur in summer months
  - Weakening of summer winds suggest summer trends are due to pressure head changes.
- ACC: AT A4, there was a much greater trend in freshening in February, twice that at A3, which likely reflects midwater freshening events

Extreme years
- Low flow in only a few months might drive the annual means
- High flow years: most months (~10) are above the mean
- Cold years: late warming and delayed arrival from the south
- Warm years: rapid spring warming determines warm years
- Fresh years: either fresher all year long or strongly in winter/spring.  However, seasonal changes may cancel out and be hidden in the annual mean.

Drivers of throughflow
- Throughflow is not the result of northward Ekman flux, but rather due to an across-slope sea level slope
- The flow increases must be primarily driven by an increase in the pressure head forcing rather than local winds
- However, this does not seem to apply at A4 (ACC)
- PH is relatively stable over the year
- Wind can explain > 50% of the variance in winter, but only 25% in summer wind-water coupling dips in Summer, explained by:
  - Winds are weaker in summer than winds in winter, so summer variability depends on PH
  - Summer wind models are bad because the winds are relatively weak
- Summer winds are weaker than the winter winds and thus presumable have comparatively less influence on flow  
- Seasonal variability:
  - The pressure head is the main responsibility for increases in transport
  - The contribution of changing winds and wind coupling is small
  - Strong winter winds provide the interannual flow variability
  - In the summer, winds are weat and the flow is PH driven

- Freshwater peak is in June with maximum transport through the strait
- Heat peak is in AUgust due to the seasonality of the ACC and sea surface temp

Summary:
- Transport: .01-.02 Sv/year increase
  - trends are clearest in summer when wind forcing is weak, which suggests the interannual changes are driven by the PH
- Velocity: <25 cm/s in low flow years, > 40cm/s in high
- Temperature and heat changes are small but vary widely annually, and fluxes of heat and salinity increase due to transport
  - The timing of the warm water arrival has been increasing by 1 day/yr
  - Salinity changes are driven by ice formation, freshening from from ice and in summer from ACC
  - May likely represents the base salinity of the throughflow
  - Seasonally, the ACC and stratification strongly influence the seasonal freshwater cycle and double the range of heat flux
