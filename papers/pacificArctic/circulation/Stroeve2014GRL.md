## Significance:
Analysis of changes in melt and freeze timing of the artcic and implications for heat storage and SST due to albedo effects.  Contains a table of melt and freeze onset by region.

## Notes:
Decreased sea ice extent is associated with a reduction in sea ice thickness.  Here, they look at trends in sea ice melt across the Arctic, as well as sea surface temperature and the changes in heat absorption due to changes in ice cover.  These are evaluated by identifying the first day of melt, the beginning of continuous melt, the first day of freeze up, and the beginning of continuous freezeup using microwave imagery from 1973 to 2013.

As expected, there is a strong latitudinal dependence in both melt and freeze.  Melt season ranges from 5-7 months in the seasonal ice zone, 2.5 months in the central arctic, and 3-5 months in the Beaufort, Chukchi, E. Siberian, Laptev, and Kara.  Most regions exhibit an earlier melt and later freeze, except the Bering, where variability is strongly tied to atmospheric circulation.  For the Arctic as a whole, the melt season has lengthened at a rate of 4 to 5 days per decade.

The largest change in albedo due to ice melt are within the Beaufort, Chukchi, and E. Siberian in september of about -9% albedo per decade.  Since there is little variability in incoming solar radiation, trends in absorbed solar radiation are a direct reflection of changes in albedo.  However the timing of melt plays a bigger role than the timing of freeze up due to the differences in radiation levels in summer vs. fall.  In the Beaufort/Chukchi, that increased heat input is equivalent to .97 to 1.3m of ice melt.  Increased air temperatures in fall result in less heat flux between the sea surface and air, resulting in delayed ice formation.
