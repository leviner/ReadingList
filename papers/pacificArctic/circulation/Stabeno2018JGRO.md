## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
08/29/2010 - 09/15/2015
## Significance:
A synthesis of mooring, drifter, model, and satellite observations of the flow and physical oceanography in the NE Chukchi Sea.

## Notes:
### Drifters
Drifters were deployed with drogues at 25-30m and describe the flow when the region is ice-free.  The general flow pattern is:
- northward flow through Bering Strait
- a separation south of ~68N where some drifters continue north through the central channel and the remainder transit west toward Herald Canyon
- a split in the central channel with a few heading towards Hannah shoal while most move towards the coast, with strong coastal Flow
- northwestward flow from Barrow canyon along the Chukchi slope

Most published information show a strong northward flow to the west of Hannah Shoal, which is not present in the drifter trajectories, which instead show eastward flow.

Highest mean velocities were in Barrow Canyon (25cm/s) with the lowest along the alaskan coast and central channel from Cape Lisburne to Wainwright (5-11cm/s)

For a drifter to be advected from Bering Strait to the slope takes ~100 days.  Other findings (Woodgate 2005, 2010) suggest this is highly variable, from 2 to 12 months depending on timing and route, though increased transport has decreased the transit time.

### Moorings
Flow patterns are similar to that observed by the drifters:
- Strong flow out of Barrow canyon
- Eastward flow along the ice cape transect
- A strong Chukchi slope current
- a weak northern flow north of Hannah shoal

Icy Cape Line
- In september, 2-layer system with cold saline bottom water and warm fresher (ACW) on top
- near-bottom currents are mostly east, strongest at C1 (inshore) and decreasing in speed as you move offshore
- During the cold season, strong flow reversals were common, resulting in southwest flow and the inflow of Atlantic water, particularly at C1, and often associated with polynya formation
- Flows strongest in the spring/summer
- Transport is dominated by short-term variability, with the greatest variations between late fall and early spring, ranging from -6 to 5 Sv.
  - Average transport was from .24 to .55 Sv, .4 over all 5 years (~40% of Bering Strait transport)
  - Transport was significantly correlated with local wind but varied interannually, though weaker during winter than summer, possibly due to the presence of ice
  - Wind is mostly towards the southwest, and strongest transport to the northeast was when winds were toward -30 to 60, weakest when -180 to -120.
- Maximum mean flows were typically from the bottom, likely because even in strong wind to the southwest, the weakest flow to the southwest was on bottom
- Water column was primarily well mixed in winter, and a two layer system in summer
  - When ice covered, bottom temps were close to freezing except during AL intrusion.  Slight salinity increases occur from brine injection with slight cooling
  - Other changes in salinity do not corresponding to temperature variability, though salinity was highly variable
  - Bottom temperatures highly variable in summer as the ice retreat and atmospheric interaction results in episodic mixing, especially during late summer and early fall when bottom water freshens and warms from mixing
- Comparing the average monthly transport at icy cape to bering strait shows a similar temporal pattern, with strongest flow in late spring and summer and weakest in late fall and early winter.
  - The largest ratio of transport at icy cape to bering strait occurs in summer (~.5), and smallest in winter (<.2).  Maximum is in july at .83
  - The monthly mean transports are significantly correlated, likely due to the strong seasonal signal, and the correlation of the winds at both sites


Along the Coast
- The strongest flows in the shelf occur along the Coast, with the fastest flow closest to Barrow Canyon.  The timing of AW arrival during reversal periods at the moorings heading down the coast indicate Barrow Canyon is the conduit of the upwelling.
- The flow rates are twice as fast in spring/summer than fall/winter

North of Hannah Shoal
- Weakest mean flow, averaging ~2-3 cm/s
- Average flow was eastward, with common reversals
- strongest during spring/summer

Bottom Currents and Winds
- Divided into ice covered and ice-free periods
- Bottom currents at C1-C6 were all significantly correlated with NARR wind products, with the wind leading by 12-18 hours, generally 10-30 degrees to the right of the winds.
- Hannah shoal sites were not correlated, with corresponds with their weak correlation to the other mooring sites

Chukchi Slope Current
- Drifters show sharp west turn out of Barrow Canyon (12 turned west, 4 went east, and 2 hit ice)
- Flow was strongest during the "warm" months when ice cover is low, and the seasonality is seen in flow down to ~300 meters
- Extends from surface to ~300m
