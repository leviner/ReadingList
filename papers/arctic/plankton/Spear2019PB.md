## Title:
Physical and biological drivers of zooplankton communities in the Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
zooplankton, advection, sea-ice, climate change
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
08/01/2010 - 08/30/2012
## Significance:
Overview of CHAOZ zooplankton catches and comparison with the physical oceanography. Findings indicate some variability in warm vs. cold years, and transport comparisons lead them to hypothesize that there is a Chukchi source of the calanus population caught on the shelf.

## Notes:
Bering Sea shelf water and the Alaska Coastal water contribute to about 1/3 of the freshwater input into the Arctic Ocean. Between 2011 and 2014, there has been a 50% increase in volume transport through Bering Strait which increases the freshwater presence in the Chukchi Sea as well as heat. The increased transport also decreases the residence time of water and plankton over the shelf.

Zooplankton communities are sensitive to changes in the environment at large spatial and temporal scales, and can be used as indicators of change. Their distribution is moderated by regional-, meso-, and local-scale physical and biological conditions. In the Arctic this includes the role of sea ice in timing of bloom and development, and during ice-free periods, they can be influenced by changing flow of water masses through the region. Here, They look at spatial abundance patterns across 3 years in relation to ice extent and advection rates at Bering Strait to connect hydrography to community structure,

They used:
- Satellite derived SST and ice concentration
- Drifter-derived flow
- Ship-based environmental conditions
- Zooplankton samples collected using a multiple-opening and closing Tucker sled
- Multivariate tests (NMDS w/ SIMPER, CAP) were conducted to look at the influence of water column properties on assemblages.

They report general results of zooplankton abundances across years, ice cover, and flow at both Icy Cape and Bering Strait. Cluster analyses (NMDS) indicated:
- 2010: 3 main groups, south, central and northern
- 2011: similar south central and northern
- 2012: five groups with greater spatial diversity

There was some separation of groups when plotted in relation to temperature and salinity, though the were low variability in both 2010 and 2011. There was high variability in 2012, but there was more overlap in temperature and salinity signatures of the 5 cluster groups. The strongest interactions were for the zooplankton southwest of icy cape where it is more strongly correlated with T&S, particularly the inner stations. It appears that the zooplankton assemblages are decoupled from warm/cold years. In cold, low transport years, neocalanus can be seen nearshore and retained in the southern chukchi rather than offshore and north in the Bering Summer Water in warmer years. At the same time euphausiids were more abundant in colder years, potentially due to the extended ice-algae bloom. Similarly, calanus were highest in the northeast, which was also an area of increasing chlorophyll likely due to the retreating sea ice and associated algae.

Comparing the development times of clanus with the drifter speeds and the stages caught indicates that many of the early stage caught in the northeast orginated in the Chukchi, and thus there may be more influence of local production. The alternative is advection from the Beaufort onto the shelf during episodic upwelling events, but still supports limited seeding of the glacialis population in the Beaufort Sea.
