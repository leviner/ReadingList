## Significance:
Description of the late-summer zooplankton community composition at Hannah Shoal during August of 2012 and 2013, focusing on copepods and euphausiids of interest for bowhead whales.

## Notes:
Hannah Shoal is seasonally ice-covered, lays between the central channel with bering seas summer water and the eastern pathway of the Alaskan coastal current to the east.

Most of the plankton community originates in the Bering, though zooplankton biomass at Hannah Shoal is lower than the shelfbreak and much of the primary production falls to the seafloor.

Community has previously been observed to be dominated by C. glacialis and C. hyperboreaus, and Pacific'Bering species of Neocalanus and C. marshallae might be present as well.  Calanus and Neocalanus are lipid rich and are of particular interest for the higher trophic levels, and serve as indicies of water masses (Glacialis from north and south, Neocalanus from Bering, hyberboreaos from north).  Possible episodic transport of high abundances of different species groups throughout the season.

Zooplankton were collected with bongo nets.  Pseudocalanus species were not differentiated, and marshallae/glacialis were grouped when visually identified.  A sample were genetically tested (16S) for arctic/bering/marshallae identification.

C. glacialis/marshallae were most dominant by abundance, followed by pseudocalanus spp.  Abundances were greater in 2012 than 2013.  At most locations, C. glacialis was dominated by the copepodite stages I-III.  Euphausiids were rare, and mero plankton (barnacle larvae, polychaete, cyrpriids, echinoderm, bivalve larvae) made up about 33% of the total abundance.

Top 6 most abundant were C. glacialis C1-C3, pseudocalanus sp., bivalve and barnacle larvae, Oithona sp., and echinoderm larvae (2012) or polychaete (2013).

Both arctic and bering haplotypes of C. glacialis were collected in both years.

Arctic species were observed, and the greater southward extent in 2013 is likely due to persistent southerly winds moving plankton onto the shoal.

It does appear that the abundance of copepods has increased since previous studies have calculated abundances.  Work done a few years earlier in the central Chukchi had comparable composition and abundances.  This suggests that the function of mesozooplankton on the carbon cycle at Hannah SHoal is similar to that in other regions of the Chukchi.
