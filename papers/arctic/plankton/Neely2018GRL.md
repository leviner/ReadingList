## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
05/01/2011 - 10/01/2011
## Significance:
Multivariate classification of phytoplankton groups in association with ice and ice-free conditions in the N. Chukchi sea, showing clear variability as a function of depth and ice presence during the ICESCAPE program.

## Notes:
Mixing, or lack thereof, under sea ice can structure the phytoplankton community by creating favorable conditions for different species. It's necessary to understand the mechanisms that drive the relationship between environment and community composition in both ice and ice-free periods.

We expect smaller phytoplankton to dominate in calm, low-nutrient conditions, while larger phytoplankton succeed in turbulent conditions that provide higher nutrient concentrations. Here, they use data from the ICESCAPE program in summer 2011 to compare communities and environmental drivers in ice and ice-free conditions.

CTD samples collected at 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 m depths when available, using flowcytobot counts for taxonomy.

Phytoplankton clustered into 4 groups and considered in a CCA against environmental conditions: rare, ice-bloomers (found in the presence of sea ice and high Si), spring bloom/high carbon (SCM, high DIN and P), and oligotrophic phtyoplankton (warm, ice-free waters).

PCA shows division along shallow/deep samples and ice/no ice.  Based on trajectory of warming in the PAR, they expect the oligotrophic group to expand in presence. Confirmed that phytoplankton community structure is driven by a function of stratification, nutrients and light.
