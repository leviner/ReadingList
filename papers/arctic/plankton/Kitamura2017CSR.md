## Significance:
Use of AZFPs to describe the seasonality of zooplankton biomass, and identify the dominant scatterers in the southern Chukchi Sea, finding a seasonal peak in biomass in autumn and a minimum in early spring, not corresponnding with phytoplankton production.  Zooplpankton communities in the southern Chukchi are largely driven by advection from the Bering.

## Notes:
Seasonality of zooplankton influences carbon flux to the benthos, but changes in arctic zooplankton population is still poorly understood.

Goals: describe the present state of seasonality of zooplankton biomass to establish a baseline and understand the implications on benthic-pelagic coupling.

AZFP at 125 and 200 kHz (other frequencies failed), plus SBE 37 microcat and chlorophyll/turbidity sensor.  Used daily satellite ice from SSMI, and sst from modis.

Used a SNR threshold of 10db, excluded top 10m due to bubbles, 5m from transducer face, which were already placed at 7m off bottom, meaning sA values are only for 10 - 28 meters in the 40m water column.  This does include the depth (seasonally) of the chlorophyll max.

Increase in Sa coincided with an increase in water temperature in the bottom layer (meaning 7m where the instrument was).  Rate of Sa increase was higher in warmer temps.

They used db differencing and forward calcs to do taxa identification, but also had a few net samples.  Cops and euphs were the most dominant groups.  Small euphausiids were collected in july and larger ones in autumn, while copepod biomass decreased from july to october.

Used 3 categories of acoustic grouping:
- small zoops (Sv200-125 > 5db)
- large zoops and non-swimbladder fish (0 - 5 db)
- fish, excluding larval non swim bladder fish (> 5db)

According to those categories, large zooplankton are the dominant scatterers from mid-summer to autumn, then small zooplankton in winter until early summer.

Concluding hypotheses
* High sA in autumn in the chukchi is likely from the advection of large zooplankton from the Bering Sea.
* A decrease in large pacific zooplankton populations in winter may indicate an unsuccessful overwintering, leading to an increase in the benthic carbon supply.
