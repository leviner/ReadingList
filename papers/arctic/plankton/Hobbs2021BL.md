## Title:
A marine zooplankton community vertically structured by light across diel to interannual timescales
## Keywords:
zooplankton, predation, migration, moorings, time series
## Geographic Coverage
Kongsfjorden, Svalbard
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Use of adcps to monitor the seasonal and interannual variability in vertical position of the zooplankton community. A defined modeled isolume can be used to represent the shallow boundary of zooplankton.

## Notes:
ADCPs (300 kHz) were deployed for 3 yeas at ~100m depth (site depth of 230 m). CoM was calculated from acoustics. Light at surface was estimated from a model. Chl_a was measured from the oceanographic mooring.

The shallow limit of the zooplankton scattering layer is consistent with the 10^-7 isolume. In winter (Nov - Jan), the zoop remain shallow (<100m) with minimal DVM response. Into spring, the chl a tracks the shallow isolume, as do the zoop as they DVM which reduces into summer (full sun). During the spring bloom, you can see a shallowing of the isolume likely as a result of shading from the bloom.

Changes in light exposure as a result of reduced sea ice could alter the forage efficiency of visual predators. However, this is dependent on the evolutionary habits of the zooplankton. Zooplankton may deepen and lose their own foraging activity to avoid predation. In shallow areas there is a limitation on this vertical shift.
