## Title:
Lingering Chukchi Sea sea ice and Chukchi Sea mean winds influence population age structure of euphausiids (krill) found in the bowhead whale feeding hotspot near Pt. Barrow, Alaska
## Keywords:
zooplankton, composition, distribution, copepod
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:


## Notes:
Goal is to investigate if the krill population structure is correlated with large-scale atmospheric drivers and water masses/sea ice.

Data
- 10 years (2005 - 2015) of collections at DBO 5 near Barrow Canyon
- Zooplankton collections using a ring net or tucker trawl
- CTD collections
- Sea ice concentration from the NOAA OISST
- Sea level pressure and winds from NCEP

There are three key species of euphausiids (T. rashcii, T. inermi, and T. longipes, though longipes was rare). The proportion of juveniles and adults varied interannually, and together among species. This proportion (JAD) was strongly correlated with the late-spring Chukchi Sea ice extent (comparison of normalized anomaly). It was also well correlated with the volume of late season melt water, thus years with late ice retreat (and high volume of meltwater remaining late in season) were associated with a higher proportion of juveniles and adults near Pt. Barrow.
