## Title:
Ice, wind, and water: Synoptic-scale controls of circulation in the Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
circulation, wind, upwelling, polynya, sea ice
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Bering Strait
## Field Dates:
07/01/2013 - 10/01/2014
## Significance:
SYnthesis of mooring, satellite, model, and weather statio data to look at relationship between circulation, wind, and sea ice over 1 year in the Chukchi Sea. Identifies modes of flow driven by northeasterly winds.

## Notes:
This is a long dense synthesis in PO, primarily centered around a series of EOF analyses of currents and wind fields to identify major modes in currents that could alter circulation on the shelf and decribe the relationship between Barrow Canyon and Bering Strait flow.

Key takeaways:
- Local winds have strong influence, in particular driving upwelling
- Upwelling must be perisiten in order to bring Atlantic water onto the shelf which is a major driver of polynya formation
- Two primary modes of circulation on the shelf:
    - weak northeasterly winds result in strong northward flow at Bering strait and coherrent flow to the northeast in Barrow Canyon
    - under variable wind, these two can oppose each other
