## Title:
The Dominant Role of the East Siberian Sea in Driving the Oceanic Flow Through the Bering Straitâ€”Conclusions From GRACE Ocean Mass Satellite Data and In Situ Mooring Observations Between 2002 and 2016
## Keywords:
Arctic Ocean, satellite, ocean bottom pressure, pressure head
## Geographic Coverage
Bering Strait
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Use of satellite-derived mean ocean bottom pressure which indicates that the dominant driver of variability in Bering trait throughflow is low sea surface height in the East Siberian Sea as a result of westward winds moving water from the shelves to the basin.

## Notes:
Short-term variability at Bering Strait is generally attributed to local wind variability, and in with no wind flow is northward, attributed to the pressure head field. It's unclear what points should be used to measure this pressure head when looking at the SSH gradient across the strait, though previous work has indicated that it is mostly driven from the south. Here, they use observations of the gravity field from the GRACE satellite mission (2002-2016) to look at ocean bottom pressure to look at the drivers of monthly and seasonal variation in the throughflow as a function of the pressure head.

- GRACE: monthly composite ocean bottom pressures which are used to estimate water thickness
- Atmospheric reanalysis for wind
- In situ observations of northward water velocities from moorings at Bering Strait

The strongest correlation between ocean bottom pressure is in the Eastern Siberian Sea, where EOF shows the greatest magnitude related to the low pressure north of the strait. To the south, the pattern is dominated by the Bering Sea Shelf. The ESS has a negative peak of 9-10 cm/std, over 5 times stronger than the pattern on the Bering Shelf. Essentially the pressure head forcing is driven by changes in the Arctic rather than the Bering. When local winds are removed, the westward pan-arctic winds drive water from the ESS reducing sea height and increasing the pressure difference.

Local winds account for less of the flow variance in summer. Ocean bottom pressure and northward velocity show similar patterns in summer, consistent with the weaker wind field. The patterns related to the pressure head in the annual cycle are repeated in summer, thus variability in summer is driven by processes in the Arctic. In winter the correlations between flow and OBP are weaker, reflecting a larger role of local winds. The variability in winter has three forcings: the local wind, a ssh high in the Bering Sea, driven by low SLP in the north Pacific and Bering, and a SSH low in the ESS driven by the westward winds.
