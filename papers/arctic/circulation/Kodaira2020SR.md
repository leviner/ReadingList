## Notes:
Arctic sea ice is influenced by both the Arctic ocean and the atmosphere. The advective heat flux from the Pacific is smaller than that from the Atlantic, but it enters the Arctic closer to the surface and thus directly impats ice. This can trigger a positive feedback mechanism which enhances wind-driven sea ice export as well.

Here, they evaluate the inerannual variation of the Pacific Artic Ocean, looking at atmospheric models to find the drivers of SST anomalies in fall 2018 and determine what causes the delay in sea ice advance.

In November 2018, seawater was anomalously warm. Historically these temperatures in the Chukchi and Bering are significantly correlated with PDO variability, however 2018 was exceptionally high given the PDO index. Since the residence time on the shelf is ~3 months, high November temperatures indicate high September temperatures. In September 2018, there was a southerly wind anomaly over Bering Strait, increasing transport by .7 Sv. This wind was the result of an episodic high pressure system over the Bering Sea.

The delay in sea ice formation in November could be the result of surface warming due to upward heat transfer from wind/wave mixing, or the horizontal advection of warm water. Ship-based ADCP observations indicate that water in the MIZ was being transported in from the Chukchi Sea where SST temperatures remained high, and salinity tracing indicates northeast transport of pacific water along the MIX.

The primary cause of the anomalously warm and open Chukchi Sea in fall 2018 appears to be the atmospheric blocking in the Bering which led to the increased transport of heat onto the shelf, which in turn delayed sea ice advance into fall.
