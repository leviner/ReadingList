## Significance:
Study of Barrow Canyon upwelling, describing differences in warm and cold seasons and wind speed dependence.

## Notes:
Upwelling in barrow canyon can bring Atlantic water onto the shelf.  Upwelling is believed to be caused by propogation of the shelf edge waters, changes in sea level pressure gradient, and southward flow dur to temporal variations in the outflow.  The most common mechanism of upwelling is enhanced easterly/northeasterly winds.  Here, they use two years of mooring data to investigate different aspects of the wind-driven Barrow Canyon upwelling, and look at interannual variability.

The two-year mean velocity is 20 cm/s down canyon, with a 2 m/s wind up canyon.  Pacific waters enter Barrow canyon from the ACC and central channel.  They use potential temperature-salinity ranges for different water masses to classify.

On average, flow was down canyon during each month except in february (-10 cm/s), with the maximum flow in summer (july @ 40 cm/s).  From January to May, the water was near freezing, warming to a maximum temperature in september, then cooling into the fall.  Salinity was lowest in summer/fall.  ~80% of the deep flow through the canyon head (67m) consisted of cold and dense winter waters.

The winds are out of the northeast during each month of the year, with stronger winds in the fall and winter.  Winds are driven by the Beaufort high and Aleutian Low:
- Warm period (summer): BH is centered over the Beaufort sea with a weak AL in the eastern Bering.  
- Cold period (winter): HB gets stronger and potentially merges with Siberian High while the AL deepens due to more storms passing through the north Pacific.  The gradient is greater, leading to stronger winds

Upwelling events: defined as periods of negative along-canyon current and winds.  Over 2 years, there wer+e 52 flow reversals, however only ~half were associated with denser waters being upwelled.  The mean velocity during upwelling events was ~35 cm/s, with a maximum of 120 cm/s, and lasted for ~2.5 days (1 to 5.5 days range).  The greatest number of upwelling events occurred in fall, fallowed by winter.  In spring, there is frequent upwelling along the shelf break, but less wind directly on the canyon axis and less upwelling through the canyon.  Wind-current time lag is ~7 hours.

In summer time, when the Pacific/Atlantic water interface is depressed (increased input of less dense water deepens the isopycnals), there is less AW water upwelled than in winter.  In the warm season, most of the upwelling events were associated with pacific winter water, commonly present in the canyon in august as it takes longer to flush from the shelf through the central channel.

Upwelling occurs in the warm months when the BH was well developed, and in the cold months when the BH and AL are anomolously strong.

There doesn't appear to be a threshold of wind speed at which upwelling is caused.  It is possible that similar to the shelf, the upwelling response is modulated by the ice cover.  The upwelling events were generally strongest during only partial ice coverage, and the weakest events occur during complete cover.  Sudden decreases in ice and the formation of the northeast chukchi polynya appear to coincide with the upwelling events, and thus the polynya record can be used to asses upwelling frequency.
