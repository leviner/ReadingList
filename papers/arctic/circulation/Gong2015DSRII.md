## Significance:
Description of the water masses and transport across the Chukchi as observed in late-summer, focussed on the flow from Bering Strait to Barrow canyon and the implications on the Arctic basin.

## Notes:
Maximum transport across the Chukchi occurs in summer when the ACC advects warm freshwater into the eastern Chukchi.  Water passes from Bering Strait across the shelf via three pathways:
- Inflow through western channel of Bering Strait follows the Hope Valley towards Herald Canyon
- Inflow on the eastern side runs parallel to the coast towards Barrow Canyon
- A central channel flows between Herald and Hannah Shoals

Transport through Bering Stait is highly variable on a scale of days to Years
- Maximum in mid-summer of 1.1-2.3 Sv (mean .7 to 1.3, largely warm ACW and moderately warm but saltier Bering Sea Water)
  - ACW in the east, BSW in the central channel after a bifurcation around Pt. Hope
- Minimum in late winter of .45-.7 Sv, cold and salty pacific winter water

Flow at Barrow is variable and complex.  Strong northeasterly winds can drive up-canyon flow in both canyons.  Circulation shows patterns on a scale of atmospheric circulation rather than rossby radius.  Out of Barrow canyon, a shelfbreak jet heads east from Barrow, where the surface state is ACW, bottom state is PWW followed by a shift to CSW/BSW.

Here, they characterize the "Bering to Barrow Current System", focused on 2010, using adcp and shipboard data from 2003, 2004, and 2010.

The two branches of the central channel and ACC were difficult to separate south of Pt. Hope, moving fast through the strait, slowing down in Kotzebue, then picking up speed as they round Pt. Hope.  North of the point, the branches diverge, where mean flow was < 20cm in the central channel, remaining slow, as ACC increased in speed as it approaches Barrow.

Summer residence from Bering Strait to Barrow Canyon can be 3 weeks for the ACC and 6-8 weeks for the channel.  At an average of only 5cm/s, it would be between 2 and 4 months.

Canyons and shoals impact the flow, with retroflections at Hannah Shoal bending flows back north and east to merge with the ACC.

Water masses:
- Warmest water is the ACW, originating in the coastal Alaska coastline south of the strait, making up about 1/3 of the eastern Chukchi.
- Coldest water is the pacific winter water, formed in the northern Bering but modified via air-sea interaction in late fall/winter over the Chukchi
  - 2 classes based on age: newly ventilated (near freezing) or remnant (slightly mixed or solar heated) winter waters, make up 1/4 to 1/3 of the NE Chukchi
- Densest and saltiest is the Atlantic water found deeper than 200m but shallower than 500m off the shelfbreak.  Occasionally upwells along the shelfbreak or via Barrow Canyon.
- Meltwater at surface, pushed north by a front of warm summer water.  Early meltwater is cold, late melt water is warm from solar heating.  While some of this may be transported fromt eh strait, pushed along the front, most is formed locally from local melt.
- Chukchi Sea Water occupies the central shelf, and originates in the central/west Bering.

The water column is divided into an upper and lower layer based around the pycnocline of 26kgm3, of which PWW is more dense.  Temperature then works as a tracer within each layer, with the lighter layer including ACW and CSW and the heavy layer mostly PWW.

CSW cools as it moves north.  Since the central channel is slower, a thin layer of WW remains at depth as it is slowly flushed north.  In Barrow Canyon, the summer and winter water masses are together, forming a 3-layer system.  The eastern side of the canyon is mostly ACC, with PWW on the western side from the central channel via the flow around Hannah Shoal.  The flow is greatest on the east side of the canyon head, though extends throughout the water column.  Flow within the canyon is entirely poleward, advecting both winter and summer water masses into the Arctic.

This transport at barrow is strongly influenced by wind, with an average of .82 Sv with mean summer wind conditions.  Most of the poleward transport south of Barrow is associated with the light summer water.  The dense PWW only becomes a significant portion of the transport at the canyon.

Most of the heat transport is within the upper portion of the water column at Barrow Canyon.  At denser levels, the northward flow results in negative poleward heat transport as PWW is flushed.  The freshwater flux, however, is positive at all depth, though a larger proportion occurs in the upper water column due to the ACC.

Heat transport in the south Chukchi is greater than that at Barrow, and is likely a sign of cooling across the shelf.  This can be due to warm water mixing with cold water at the shelfbreak or winter water still being flushed slowly through the central channel, joining the warmer water at the canyon head. It is unknown how long it takes to flush the PWW from the entire shelf.

The BBCS directly influences the internal halocline of the western Arctic.
