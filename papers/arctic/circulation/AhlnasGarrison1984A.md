## Title:
Satellite and oceanographic observations of the warm coastal current in the Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
circulation, satellite, ice, temperature
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Bering Strait
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Satellite observations of the Alaskan Coastal Current and the role of the current in the melt back of Chukchi Sea ice.

## Notes:
Satellite imagery shows the formation and intrusion of the ACC, and in situ sampling has allowed for sampling.

NOAA VHRR daily infrared data was used to look at surface temperatures. Spring Conditions:
- In late winter, the Bering Sea is covered with ice to between the Pirblofs and St. Matthews. In the Chukchi, the water is near freezing (-1.8) and high salinity water settles on bottom and heads down the canyon.
- In May, freshwater runoff absorbs solar heat at the surface and gradually mixes with the water below. Warm water builds up in the eastern bays and stretches north.
- In July warm water passes through the strait, water is warmest along the Alaska coast.  The timing of the warm water intrusion affects the shape of the ice edge, while at the same time the ice acts as a barrier against the flow of water to the north.

Warm water on the shelf originates in shallow waters such as Norton and Kotzebue sound from river runoff. By march, the layer has disappeared. Because of the complex shape of the Alaskan coast, there is mixing as small eddies and spirals form along the northward flow, which spins out when it interacts with the Beaufort gyre. The coastal current is linked to atmospheric pressure differences between the Beaufort and Bering. Northerly winds impact the ice pack flow and thus the continuity of the warm water flow.
