## Significance:
A review of the physical oceanography published in 'Fish Ecology in Arctic North America', AFS symposium proceedings.  Outlines the physical oceanography during the ice-free season in the NE Chukchi.

## Notes:
Bathymetry
- Relatively flat bottom, bounded by the shelf break to the north at ~200m-isobath.
- Currents are steered by subtle features, separating the shelf into:
  - Hope Sea Valley, approx. 55m deep, extending northwest from the southern Chukchi
  - Herald Shoal, 25m, in the central basin
  - Hannah Shoal, 25m,  in the northeast
- Shelf break features that steer currents, facilitate cross shelf exchange by steering water off the shelf and channeling upwelled water onto the shelf:
  - Herald Sea Valley, shallow canyon/valley between Wrangel Island and Herald Shoal, terminates at ~150m depth on the shelf break
  - Barrow Canyon in the northeast, terminates at ~3000m depth.

Winds
- Strongly influenced by polar high pressure cell, and on an annual mean drives easterlies over the northern Chukchi and northeasterly winds over the southern Chukchi and Bering Seas.  
- North of Pt. Lay, winds vary minimally
- South of Pt. Lay, winds switch seasonally, from the south in summer and from the north in winter.
- Southerly winds accelerate coastal currents northward, northerly winds accelerate them southward leading to horizontal gradients

Circulation
- Northward flow, mean annual transport through Bering Strait of ~.8 Sv, driven by drop in sea level between Aleutian Basin and Arctic (pressure head).
- 85% of inflow from deep Bering Sea and Gulf of Anadyr, remainder from the Bering Shelf (EBS)
- Fluctuations are driven by wind stress, with flow at minimum in winter and maximum in summer when northward winds occur more frequently
- Bifurcates when entering Chukchi
  - Alaskan Coastal Current (ACC) along the northeastern coastal within 20-50km of the coast, flowing out through Barrow
  - Remainder goes west as a diffuse northwestern current through Hope and Herald Sea valleys
- In the northern Chukchi (shelf break), there is a deep eastward current (Beaufort Undercurrent), and a shallow westward current.  Above 250m, the water is of Pacific origin.  Below 250m, the water is Atlantic.

Water Masses (Nomenclature from Coachman et al., 1975)
- Northward flow from Bering Strait is Alaskan Coastal Water (ACW) and Bering Shelf Water (BSW).
  - ACW: temperatures range from 2-13C with salinites <32.2 due to influx of freshwater from Yukon river and other discharge.  This water mass stays near the surface because of low density, and warms from solar radiation
  - BSW: 0-3C, 32.5-33 PSU, a blend of bering shelf water formed in winter and water flowing onto the shelf from deep Bering Sea and the Gulf of Anadyr, with high concentrations of dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll, also a major source of oceanic zooplankton.
- Four additional water masses:
  - Sea ice melt: low salinity and temperature
  - Resident chukchi water: advected waters from the upper Arctic ocean with low temperature and high salinity reflecting ice brine
  - Atlantic water: very high salinity (34.5) and moderate (0-1C) temperatures, found at depth along the slope of the Chukchi, upwells through the canyons (usually Barrow)
  - Near freezing waters, commonly winter Chukchi waters
- The ACC flow is augmented by horizontal pressure caused by fronts of water masses across the shelf.  Speed is dependent on the strength of the front and the slope of the seafloor.
- There are large shifts in ACC mean flow driven by north/south wind, though the velocity field across the northeast chukchi can be consistent for >350km.
- Response of the flow to wind can be <1 day, and wind history must be taken into consideration when interpreting long cruises.

Upwelling
- Offshore waters episodically upwell via Barrow Cnayon and along the Beaufort shelf break, bringing high salinity and nutrient waters into the northern Chukchi.
- Most common in fall and early winter when winds are most variable
- During multiday upwelling, episodes at .25m/s can bring water nearshore.  
- Upwelling in the western shelf break of the Chukchi may be greater due to the decrease in slope compared to the Beaufort, and the gradient in slope may be reflected in the gradient in biological activity.

Sea ice
- Generally Ice covered from November to June
- In comparison to the Beaufort and Siberian Seas, ice retreat begins earlier and advance occurs later due to the warm Pacific water advected onto the shelf.
- Ice melt back is not uniform, and normally is in 3 embayments; Herald Sea Valley and Barrow Canyon, and a third between Herald and Hannah Shoals.  
- Upwelling occurs on the windward side of an ice meander, impacting productivity associated with the ice edge.
- Ice edge zones have large spatial gradients in water, air, current, and wind conditions, typically causing upper and lower fronts, where the upper meltwater and lower resident chukchi water meet the northward-flowing ACW and BSW

High interannual variability in transport and sea ice extent, likely due to anomalies in the regional wind field.  Ice can also be impacted by coastal river discharge variability.
