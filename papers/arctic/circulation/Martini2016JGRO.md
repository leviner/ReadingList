## Title:
Dependence of subsurface chlorophyll on seasonal water masses in the Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
chlorophyll, hydrography, phytoplankton
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
08/07/2013 - 09/19/2013
## Significance:
Mapping of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum in the NE Chukchi Sea in late-summer, and the variability in nutrients and chlorophyll with hydrography and meltwater/summer water fronts.  They show that SCM depth in late summer is sensitive to seasonal changes in hydrography.

## Notes:
Yearly cycle of biology:
- Spring/summer biological cycle begins with algae along the ice edge and in some cases under sea ice
- Subsurface chlorophyll maximum develops as surface nutrients are depleted
- Fall mixing can bring new nutrients to surface, restarting late bloom

In late summer, the Subsurface Chlorophyll Max (SCM) has the highest chlorophyll concentration of the water column.

Hydrography
- Bottom and surface layers are well mixed internally, but are separated by a sharp pycnocline
- 2-layer stratified system inhibits the exchange of nutrients, salts, and heat

SCM depth is correlated with the vertical nutrient structure (mostly nitrate limited) and light availability.  Climate change impact could go two ways:
- Primary production may decrease due to freshening and deepening of nitracline as greater ice melt and river runoff floods the surface layers
- Production may increase due to increased upwelling at the Chukchi shelf due to extended open-water period and increased mixing

Data was collected using a Tow-yo'd acrobat system and from ship-based CTD casts.

SCM is defined here as the depth of the maximum chlorophyll a concentration in each casr/profile.  
- In late summer 2013, chlorophyll a was found in a layer 2-40m thick, centered between 10 and 40m depth.
- Not typically found coastally, likely due to low nutrient concentrations and reduced primary production in the ACC

Variation exists in association with hydrography
- In the south, where there is warm chukchi summer water, chl a was concentrated in a 5-10m band within the pycnocline
  - Pycnocline depth: 23m, CSM depth: 23m, shoaling 0m
- In the meltwater to the north, chl a was highest well below the pycnocline (10-30m deeper)
  - Pycnocline depth: 14m, CSM depth: 26m, shoaling 12m
  - In the meltwater regions, the SCM is found in the bottom chukchi winter water layer rather than at the pycnocline boundary of the fresh meltwater

- Currents above and below the pycnocline were in the same direction, with greater speeds at the surface due to shear
- Based on speeds, it is assumed that it takes about 17-20 weeks for the water from Bering Strait to travel to the front located at 73N, which is consistent with ice melt in mid/late-April

SCM size/extent
- .15 to 44km long, with an average of 3.6 (+-6) km (highly variable)
- Thickness of 1 to 38 m, averaging 8.4 (+-6.4) m
- Not significantly different between the cold and warm conditions
- It is possible that in 2012, based on work by danielson and observations from the tow-yo acrobat measurements, SCM patches were sparser (colder year), indicative of interannual variability.

By late August, the upper water column was nutrient depleted
- Nutrient concentrations were larger in the CWW under the MW than in the RWW under the CSW
- Nitrate was significantly higher where there was meltwater (less nutrients available in the CSW, possibly used up?)
- Nitracline deepened as meltwater became replaced with CSW

SCM depth
- CSW SCM was more likely to be found above the nitracline
- Maximum depth of the SCM is light dependent
- CSW SCM had greater PAR than the MW SCM since it was shallower
- CSW SCM may be above the nitracline since in RWW layer on bottom, light levels are likely too low to balance the nutrient levels

Biomass changes as meltwater is replaced with CSW
- The percent of total water column biomass found within the SCM was higher (46%) in the meltwater than in the CSW (31%)
- Deeper SCMs are not included in satellite-derived estimates of biomass, but Acrobat estimates show that 17-67% of the total water column biomass is possibly found in the SCM

Phytoplankton Community
- Phytoplankton size is sensitive to the changes in the upper water masses
- Higher proportions of larger phytoplankton were found in cold water than warm conditions
  - Lots of diatoms in the meltwater influenced regions, with picophytoplankton in the CSW
  - Greater concentrations of silicate in the cold conditions, available for diatom frustules
- In 2012, all of the water masses were warmer and thus had a larger proportion of small phytoplankton contributing to their biomass

As CSW replaces the meltwater, the SCM gets shallower and thins out.
