## Significance:
Numerical model to study the role of pressure head and wind forcing separately the North Pacific vs. Arctic Ocean on transport and inflow at Bering Strait.

## Notes:
It's been suggested that Bering Strait inflow is primarily driven by the pressure head forcing due to the difference between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans, and the throughflow is driven by local winds, in a 2/3:1/3 relationship. Previous work have proposed that the SSH difference between the Pacific and Arctic is influenced by surface wind stress in both regions, which drives ekman convergence and thus SSH differences (Danielson 2014). Other work suggests that throughflow variability is primarily driven by SSH change in the East Siberian Sea. Here they use numerical simulations to address the interannual variability by restricting variations to either inside or outside of the Arctic.

The transport through the strait has much lower variability than the total ocean transport, indicating that the volume transport changes are largely due to SSH. The variances aresimilar for both the Arctic Only and non=Arctic models indicating that the forcing both inside and outside of the AO are equally important to the transport. In fact the summing of volume transport anomalies from the AO and non-AO runs represents well the control run and accurately recreates both the freshwater an heat transport.
- When inflow is strong, the BH is strong and the AL is over the Aleutian Basin
- When inflow is weak, the BH is weak and the AL is over the GoA

However the variances in freshwater an heat flux are not equal.
- Atmospheric forcing in the north pacific (non-AO) leads to stronger variability in freshwater and heat.
- Northeast transport in the Bering accumulates low-salinity and high temperature water

Conclusions
- The interannual variability of the inflow is mostly driven by wind variability, with surface buoyancy (heat and salt) playing a small role
- Winds over the AO and NP have similar contributions to the variance in volume transport. The winds do not have equal contributions during anomalies.
- Wind over the NP changes the temperature and salinity at the inflow by changing volume transport and altering circulation in the Bering. These winds explain a larger part of the freshwater and heat transport than those over the AO.
- Wind forcing in the AO has a larger impact post-1994 when the variability has increased.
