## Title:
A year in the physical oceanography of the Chukchi Sea: Moored measurements from autumn 1990-1991
## Keywords:
currents, shelf dynamics, seasonal variation, transport
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
09/01/1990 - 10/01/1991
## Significance:
Mooring data from a 1-year deployment of CTDs and ADCPs across US and Russian waters of the Chukchi Shelf, to present the seasonality and flow across the entire Chukchi Sea over 1 year.

## Notes:
Bering Strait acts as the gateway for Pacific water into the Arctic, crossing the Chukchi shelf to get there.  Once in the arctic, Pacific water plays 3 roles:
- bolster the halocline
- provide nutrients
- balance freshwater

Northward flow of water out of the Strait is steered into 3 major flow paths: One to the west of Herald Shoal, feeding to Herald Valley and out to the shelfbreak, one east of Hannah Shaol and out Barrow Canyon, and one between the two flows (Central Channel).

In the Bering Strait, there are three water masses, the alaskan coastal water, bering shelf water, and anadyr water.  BSW and AW merge in the Chukchi into the Bering Sea Water (BSSW/CSSW).  The Anadyr water is the most nutrient rich.

There is also proposed water exchange to the Arctic through Long Strait, with a counter-current of cold freshwater (Siberian Coastal Current) flowing south.

Though high in interannual variability, this paper presents a snapshot of the physical processes that can occur across the entire shelf over the course of a year.

#### Methods:
Moorings were deployed in Bering Strait (3), across the Chukchi shelf (5), and at the outflow regions of Long Strait (1), Herald Canyon (2), and Barrow Canyon (1).  SeaCATs were also deployed at all sites.

Water column homogeneity is assumed to hold for water masses in autumn/winter, when vertical mixing from cooling and brine injection mixes the entirety of the shallow water column.  Where there was no further evidence to constrain stratification, homogeneity is assumed.

The dominant variability in the velocity records is not a tidal signal.  The tidal velocities are greatest in the west, where near Wrangel island, there is up to 5cm/s, though generally < 2cm/s.

#### General Flow:
Mean velocities, fast at the in/out, slow on the shelf, along the isobaths to the north:
- Bering Strait: 10-20cm/s
- Central Chukchi: 5cm/s
- Herald Calley and Barrow Canyon: 10-20cm/s


Though mean flows are slow, variability is very high, with extremely fast (80-120cm/s) observed at Bering.  As continuity would assume, max flows are slower (40-60cm/s) across the shelf, then quick again at the outflows.

Speeds are greatest in in summer and autumn, ad very weak, particularly in Barrow canyon in winter and spring.

Flow is driven by a sea-surface pressure gradient between the Pacific and Arctic oceans, and atmospheric/wind effects (atmospheric pressure gradient or local wind).

Linear fit with local wind explains 60% of the variance in the flow.  They come up with an empirical equation:

flow velocity = pressure head-derived constant + (wind-current coupling constant X wind velocity)

Seasonal presence of ice does not change flow, and ice is generally moving with the water.  The upward trend in the pressure head could indicate multi-year forcings at Bering Strait.

Confirm that:
- The flow through Bering Strait is driven by a combination of the pressure head and local wind forcings
- This is also true for the flow of the Chukchi
- Wind seems to show short-term variability, with the pressure head showing signs of longer scale changes
- Local wind appears to be a good indicator of water velocity, though not in the western Chukchi and Herald Valley regions

#### Residence time
Based on the annual mean velocities in the central shelf, there is about a 4-month period between Bering Strait and either Herald or Barrow.

Parcels starting in winter months will take closer to 6 months, except in the far west where the siberian coastal current has a greater impact.

#### Temperature and salinity
In general:
- temperature cools in autumn: wind cools the surface water which mixes the water column overall
- salinizes in winter: as ice starts to form there's an overall increase of ~2psu, possibly with an advective influence since.  You can see this influence in the temperature record as temperatures previously flirting with 0 drop to near -2 as salinity increases. 1-2m ice is not sufficient to create this much of an increase
- warms and freshens in spring: this begins under sea ice and continue until ice has melted

Confirm that:
- Large seasonal cycles in TS exist, with most of the variability in the east, and the changes occur on the time scale of transport from Bering to Barrow.
- for autumn/winter, all of the region is in a small TS space, so primarily driven by storm mixing, surface cooling, and brine
- strong influence of advective waters: large currents (Bering strait), coastal currents (ACC, SCC), and episodice water mass formation (polynyas)

Contrary to theory that the early ice formation in the north would cause salinity increases there first, you instead see salinity increase seasonally in the south.  This implies advection of a seasonal salinity signal from Bering strait to the central chukchi. **"Salinity input through Bering Strait determines the general properties of the Chukchi"**

Rapid rises in salinity can form from coastal polynyas.

There is generally more flow on the western side of the shelf.  The outflows at Long Strait, Herald, and Barrow are fairly even, and they suggest there is a fourth exit along the central channel.  "...the picture emerges of the outflows from
the Chukchi as a set of streams, each varying in volume, TS throughout the year, with resultant varying input depths to the Arctic Ocean"

- The seasonal variation from the inflow at Bering Strait is larger than any changes that occur across the shelf
- waters tend to be cooled, but limited change in salinity
- At cold temperatures, density is driven more by salinity, thus the inflow at the strait can serve as a proxy of ventilation
