## Significance:
Study of the movement of winter water in the NE Chukchi Sea, describing the circulation and transport around Hanna Shoal towards Barrow Canyon.

## Notes:
In the summer and early fall, the ACC carries most of the water across the NE Chukchi shelf, along with the central channel branch.  Here, they investigate the circulation of pacific winter water on the NE Chukchi shelf via measurements collected as part of the ICESCAPE program through a combination of shipboard ADCP/CTD measurements and moorings.

The mean wind during the study was about 6.6m/s to the south, southwest, slightly enhanced easterlies relative to the climatology.  By the time of the survey, the water may have warmed somewhat.  Here, they define the winter water as mostly newly ventilated winter water, with temperatures less than -1.6C and salinity of 31.5-33.5 PSU.  ~35% was less than -1.6, with elevated nitrate concentrations at depth.

The are 2 jets moving winter water off of the shelf in the eastern Chukchi:
1. The central channel pulls water poleward - roughly half of whichends up flowing on either side of hanna shoal
- Hanna shoal is also warm, but most of the deep basin is cold ad filled with winter water of similar properties
- The central channel is joined by water diverted from Herald.  This branch splits at Hanna Shoal, with PWW going around both sides, with a roughly equal split.
 - To the north side, some portion of the water is directly diverted to the shelf break
- The water from the CC moves into centeral channel, where it divides and about half goes north and half goes south
2.  The ACC moves strongly poleward, pulling winter water with it
- This pathway is the warmest, extending into Barrow canyon

Between these two jets, there is a weakly reversed flow jet of winter water, potentially pulling winter water south.  There is also a shelfbreak jet fed by herald canyon.

This results in 2 ways of water to get into Barrow Canyon: 1. through the direct coastal flow, and 2. a slower and circuitous pathway via a large number of small filaments.  Both of these pathways are equal in volume, though the flow in the canyon is greater on the eastern flank.

Though none was observed, there was likely winter water present at Icy Cape earlier in the year.

Changes in the winter water properties over the year: there was little change in temperature but there was increased salinity of the later arriving winter water north of Bering Strait.  This was likely modified during transport across the shelf (not originating from different water).  Sea ice concentrations shows the formation of a Cape Lisburne polynya.  There is an overall trend of increasing salinity in parcels leaving Bering Strait between late-March and early-April, due to this polynya.

Summary:
- The central channel branch approaches hanna shoal and bifurcates around both sides before dividing into smaller filaments that enter Barrow canyon.
- There is some portion of water assumed to be recirculated to the west of Hanna shoal.
- WHile temperature of the winter water was consistent during observation, salinity varied: this is likely due to polynya presence along the coast.
