## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage
Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
05/22/1975 - 04/31/1979
## Significance:
They investigate enhanced productivity and upwelling at the ice edge in the Eastern Bering Sea

## Notes:
Phytoplankton production on the EBS shelf exceeds the demand.  While similar to a classic spring time bloom, it is enhanced by ice melt, influencing the water column structure (keeping it stratified) and shifting the light regime as ice melts.

Surveys were done during the fisheries and hydrographic surveys in 1975, 76 and 79.

Observations show that later in the season, the ice edge bloom sinks into deeper water, where on the shallow shelf it can still be capable of photosynthesis.  The seasonal primary production is highest at the ice margin due to the physical structural changes caused by the melt water.  The surfacing of the iso-pycnals and halines that form seaward of the ice edge are caused by both ice melt and divergence driven by ekman transport at the edge where wind can now influence the surface.

Unlike along a coastline, the ekman divergance can occur in both directions, pulling water up and under the ice.

They suggest that in most of their data, a spring bloom does not occur under the ice away from the edge.  High phytoplankton production occurs in areas of frontal structures forming at the ice edge.
