## Title:
The Polar  Night Shift: Annual Dynamics  and  Drivers  of  Microbial  Community Structure in the Arctic Ocean
## Keywords:
microbes, Arctic, bacteria, seasonality
## Geographic Coverage
Fram Strait
## Field Dates:
07/01/2016 - 08/01/2017
## Significance:
Year long observations of shifts in the microbial community in Fram Strait. Use of RAS for collection and preservation of samples

## Notes:
They deployed two remote access samplers in Fram Strait on bth the inflow and outflow sides: East Greenland Current (southward) and West Spitsbergen Current (northward).

Water was collected at 20 meters (WSC) and 80 meters (EGC) over the course of a year. Samples were spiked with mecuric chloride and filtered upon recovery before dna extraction and 18s and 16s amplification. CTD sensors were also positioned on the RAS.

Results/Conclusions
- There is strong seasonality in both currents. in the WSC, community cycling followed the solar cycle with significant differences between winter and summer communities.
- Winter nutrient cycling due to wind mixing was a significant factor in restructuring
- Spring/summer succession in the bacterial community was paralleled by phytoplankton transitions
- Ice cover in the EGC likely resulted in the reduced seasonality observed
