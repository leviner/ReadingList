## Significance:
Biophysical modeling of early life history for walleye pollock in the EBS, suggesting temperature (ice conditions) and the resultin difference in temperature-dependent growth is the primary driver of inerannual variability in distribution.

## Notes:
There are two primary spawning sites in the EBS, where spawning occurs from spring to summer. Eggs can be found as deep as 300m, but tend to be within the upper 30 m of the water column. Hatch day is temperature dependent, and swimming ability increases at 10-17 mm.

The advection of these eggs depends on the atmospheric and oceanic forcings, typically following a strong northward flow of the coastal current. Variability in larval distribution could result from either advective transport or biological response to conditions. These mechanisms, particularly between warm and cold years are unknown, and they hypothesize that the physical forcings are dominant.

Used a ROMS model with TRACMASS IBM in 1 h steps, with random turbulence included. 10 particles per 10m depth increments per spawning location were seeded. Data on spawning and distribution of fishes came from mocness and bongo collections during the FOCI BSIERP program.

Fish growth was modeled as a function of temperature and age. Vertical behavior was based on depth=stratified sampling. To look at warm vs. cold years, the spawning period was altered by a) no difference b) delay in spawning in cold year c) advance in spawning in warm year d) contracted spawning area in cold years, and e) expanded spawning area in warm years.

COG of final simulations were more sensitive to age-dependent growth then vertical behavior (i.e., temperature-dependent growth led to more on shelf particles). When intial conditions wee consistent and only interannual variability in the forcing (not the spawning period) were different, there were only small differences between warm and cold years.

The model showed a greater sensitivity to growth than vertical behavior. If transport did not did not change between warm and cold years, it would take longer to observe a later stage fish in cold years simply due to growth. The COG in cold vs warm years were not different enough to indicate that differences in circulation in warm vs. cold are enough to justify changes in distribution.

Continued changes in ice and water temperatures are expected to alter the distribution of spawning adults, so it will be important to investigate the potential or changes in predator-prey spatial overlap in difference conditions.
