## Significance:
Observations of the foraging behavior of birds relative to environment (wind, sea state) and cod availability (schooling vs. non-schooling) in the Canadian High Arctic. Kleptoparasitism appears to be highly efficient foraging method, while dive plunging to depth allows for feeding in non-schooling and lower visibility conditions.

## Notes:
Foraging behavior of top predators in the Arctic is lacking.  Seabirds use plunge diving, surface dipping, and pursuit diving to capture prey, including kleptoparasitism from other birds/animals.  Kleptoparastism often requires less energy.

The main prey for marine seabirds in the Canadian High Arctic is b. saida.  Large feeding aggregations of birds and mammals have been described in relation to b. saida schools.  Here, they describe the relationship between seabirds and b. saida in Allen bay to 1) determine density of seabirds 2) look at bird behavior relative to the environment 3) describe bird-bird interactions and 4) determine the importance of b. saida schools.

Northern fulmars and black-legged kittiwakes were the most abundant seabirds.  Kittiwakes were more likely to be on ice while fulmars were on water.  Fulmars, kittiwakes, and jaegers were more active in early morning, with southerly winds.

Fulmars successfully captured cod 24% from air and 19% from surface.  Kittiwakes success from air was 49%, with no observations of diving from water surface.

Foraging:
- Strong association with wind activity from the south may be due to increased movement (transport) of fish into the area.
- kleptoparasitic species showed no specific affinity for stealing from other species, suggesting, their movements were environmentally driven.
- Wind speed and beaufort scale affected gull activity, likely due to visibility.

Feeding Behavior:
- Fulmars can only dive <2.6m, making it more difficult to pursue non schooling cod, and lower visibility inhibits their success.  Higher morning success may be due to higher abundances of fish near the surface still feeding on migrated zooplankton.
- Kittiwakes dive plunge to feed, and high success may result in shorter foraging bouts.  They can feed in poor conditions due to their efficiency at feeding independent of schools, making them less impacted by weather.
- Gulls and jaegers were responsible for most of the stolen cod, capturing prey from another bird in ~50% of attempts.  Kleptoparasitism appears to be more energetically efficient then direct foraging of cod.
