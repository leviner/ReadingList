## Title:
Distinct patterns of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) presence and absence in a shallow high Arctic embayment, revealed across open-water and ice-covered periods through acoustic telemetry
## Keywords:
tracking, telemetry, arctic cod, canada, bay
## Geographic Coverage
Resolute Bay
## Field Dates:
08/01/2012 - 04/30/2013
## Significance:
The authors use acoustic telemetry (tagging) to investigate the spatial distribution of arctic cod in Resolute Bay in ice free and covered periods, and their presence in relation to environmental changes and predator presence.

## Notes:
Sea ice extent in the Canadian high arctic has been changing significantly, which has introduced more ecosystem disruption through increased vessel activity.

In the canadian arctic archipeligo, arctic cod use shallow embayments in the summer months due to their high productivity from mixing and river outflows, as well as thermal refuge.  These shallow embayments are also important feeing areas for higher level predators (whales and other marine mammals).

Rod and reel were used to tag individuals, likely leading to some bias as the more "hearty" fish would be more successful being tagged and limited the size of the fish.

49 Vemco receivers were deployed in the bay for over a year, and 85 fish were tagged, with two large exits from the region observed.  Residence time of tagged individuals ranged from 30 to 259 days, with large groups of fish leaving a returning over the course of both the fall and winter.  The initial departure corresponded with a steep drop in temperature.  The majority of the fish sampled were representative of one larger school.

The second departure, with no specific environmental associations, may be affiliated with a spawning event.

There appears to be a balance between resource availability and predation risk, and the increased us (resident index) of the deeper locations (low predation) near outflows (nutrient/productivity increases) supports that hypothesis.  During ice covered periods, the shallow areas were more utilized (no pressure from whales).

Concluding hypotheses
* Shallow arctic embayments are important habitats for A. cod, present year round
* These embayments are likely important feeding grounds for birds and whales
* A combination of resource availability and predation risk may serve as a trigger for spawning an changes in distribution
