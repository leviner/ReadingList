## Title:
Climate-related changes in the biomass and distribution of small pelagic fishes in the eastern Bering Sea during late summer, 2002â€“2018
## Keywords:

## Significance:
Analyses of fish biomass and distribution with changing SST in the eastern Bering Sea, includes use of VAST model for mapping species distribution.

## Notes:
The goal of this work was to look at the impact of changing SST on the distribution of key pelagic fish in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) over a period from 2002 to 2018 which includes both warm and cold periods.

Samples are from 13 years of Cantrawl sampling on a station grid (30 min tows). Sampling spacing changed between yers, but is accounted for the in the geostatistical vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model which interpolates species biomass (and thus distribution) across comparable region of the EBS in all years. The VAST model was used to calculate the probability of encounter and the positive catch rate as the predictors, with spatal and spatio-temporal effects. These predictors of catch rate and encounter are used to predict population density and abundances. Biomass was them calculated from the densities, and center of gravity and area occupied were calculated based on the biomass.

Results
- For the main fish species: juvenile sockeye salmon tended to be distributed in the south EBS; herring were found in the north EBS; and juvenile pink salmon, juvenile chum salmon, age-0 pollock, and capelin were in the north and south EBS
- Age 0 pollock and herring made up the majority of the biomass, though they also had the largest interannual ranges
- they include reports of species correlations for biomass, northing, easting, and effective area occupied. In general, biomass among salmons was positively correlated
- Capelin biomass significantly decreased with warming SST. Herring, Juvenile sockeye, and age-0 pollock increased with a rise in SST (they report linear equations for all 6 species and SST)
- Fish appear to move further away from the coast (decreased eastings) with higher SSTs
- Warming seems to favor the biomass of herring, age-0 pollock, and juvenile sockeye. It's possible that poor net sampling belwo the thermocline may have an impact o these results.
- Northward movement of fishes with warming was observed for capelin and juvenile sockeye salmon, which may move to track the large zooplankton in the colder waters.
