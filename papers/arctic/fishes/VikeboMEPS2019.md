## Title:
Drift, growth, and survival of larval Northeast Arctic cod with simple rules of behaviour
## Keywords:
model, behavior, arctic cod, vertical migration
## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Modeling efforts to investigate the role of vertical behavior on dispersion and success.

## Notes:
Drift trajectory is dependent on 1) time and location of spawning and 2) the interaction between circulation and behavior.

In pelagic species, swimming ability changes ontogenetically, and may impact dispersal relative to simply passive drift.  Zooplankton and fish exhibit DVM and onotogenetic migration, which here they couple with an ocean circulation model to evaluate the effect of vertical migration on larval transport and larval survival.

All larvae were initialized at 3.53mm.  For the individual model, the following were independently changed throughout the model:
- Growth, including food limitations and light dependent foraging success, size-dependent metabolism, and swimming cost
- Predation, as a function of size and light
- Light at depth based on lamber-beers

Individuals select the next depth to be at as a function of risk sensitivity and maximizing growth (food availability).  Risk sensitivity was modeled as both genetically set and shifting later in ontogeny.  Fitness was evaluated as the total survival probability from spawn to 18mm.
