## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

06/01/2012 - 10/01/2013
## Significance:
Model of Arctic cod presence/absence and abundance in comparison with abiotic and biotic factors. Based on 2012 and 2013 Arctic Eis data and work done in other regions, they estimate the potential of the age-1+ stock to produce the number of age-0 Arctic cod observed in the summer surveys, and find the estimates to be much lower than what is observed, providing a set of potential explanations.

## Notes:
1. Modeled CPUE of age-0 and age-1+ Arctic cod relative to temperature, salinity, productivity, competitors, and prey
2. Estimate the age structure, abundance, biomass and reproductive potential to inform a Leslie Matrix model with updated life history info to determine if the adult population is capable of producing the age-0 populations observed

Model parameters for predicting abundance of age-0 were SST, integrated water column chlorophyll, calanus spp. densities (prey), capelin CPUE (competitor), and lions mane jellyfish (predator). For age-1+, they used bottom temperature, bottom salinity, integrated water column chlorophyll, and calanus spp. abundace.

Probability of age-0 cod presence was modeled as a linear function with no interactions.  For the CPUE where present, it was modeled as a GAM.  age-1+ Arctic cod were similarly modeled as a GAM.  AIC was used to determine the most important variables.  Abundance at age was determined separately for the northern and southern regions base don growth rates (Helser 2017).

They estimated egg production based on values from literature and other north Pacific gadids, as well as Svalbard.  Egg production > fraction of eggs that survive to hatch (0.21 day-1 based on pollock, mean egg duration to hatch of 72.8 days) > larval daily instantaneous mortality estimate (estimated as natural mortality of 0.0413 day-1).  

Results
- Best fit model for age-0 included terms for year, SST, abundance of capelin, and abundance of copepods, though only SST has highly significant.  Probabilty of occurence decreased from ~100% at the coldest temperatures to 20-40% at the warmest temperatures.  Probability of occurence increased with capelin abundance and decreased with calanus abundance.
  - Based on the best fit model for CPUE-where-present of age-0 Arctic cod, their abundance was significantly related to SST and chlorophyll a and differed significantly between 2012 and 2013
  - CPUE was at a maximum at ~6.5C (SST), near the opportunistic maximum growth temperature for the fish.
- For age-1+ fish, bottom temperature and bottom salinity were confounding (makes sense) so were separately modeled
  - Age-1+ occurred at all temperatures, CPUE was high at low temperatures, peaking around ~6 before declining.  
  - Lowest abundances were in low-salinity warm ACC water
  - Temperature was more significant than salinity
- Total abundance of age-1+ was 3.9 billion (2.1-6.2), estimated biomass of (44,500 mt), with a reproductive potential of 5.9 trillian eggs (3.6-8.7 trillion)
- Based on estimates of egg production, egg duration, egg mortality, larval duration, and larval mortality, they estimate an abundance of age-0 arctic cod at roughly
  - 11 billion fish, 750 million to 158 billion at low egg mortality
  - 3 thousand fish, 1 - 16 million at high egg mortality
- The upper end of the low mortality estimate is significantly below the 247 billion estimate of age-0 fish in the 2013 survey.  **These results suggest that there are not enough eggs to produce the estimated number of age-0 fish from the acoustic surveys.**

Discussion
- The observed number of adults in the survey region is unlikely to account for the number of observed offspring, suggesting a missing biomass of adults, advection of young fish from outside the study region, failure of model assumptions, or data quality issues
- Temperature was strongly linked with age-0 distribution.  Larger extent of ACW may have restricted suitable habitat for age-0, while cool waters in 2013 supported larger numbers.  
- Lower transport in 2012 may have brought fewer eggs onto the shelf from Bering spawning sites.
- Age 0 Arctic cod decreased with density of calanus, indicating possible top-down control, and arctic cod may be responsible for depleting local zooplankton populations.
- GAM for age-1+ suggests that temperature and salinity drove abundance, with lowest densities appearing in the ACC.
- "The low biomass in the Chukchi Sea, combined with a short open water season (limited accessibility), low market value (if sold as fishmeal), remote location, and lack of infrastructure likely make a fishery cost prohibitive"

Explanations for low adult to age-0:
1. either mature fish are migrating into the Chukchi to spawn in the winter,
2. age-0 fish originate from a larger spawning population outside the study area with the northeast Chukchi Sea serving as a nursery area,
3. we are underestimating the abundance of mature Arctic cod in the study area,
4. we are underestimating their reproductive potential, or
5. incorrectly estimating their early life survival
