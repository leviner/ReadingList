## Title:
Effects of the timing of sea ice retreat on demersal fish assemblages in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas
## Keywords:
arctic cod, recruitment, ice breakup, bloom
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Time series of demersal fish finding time of sea ice retreat had a significant impact on interannual changes in species groupings. Example of multivariate exploration of bottom temperature and ice on assemblages.

## Notes:
The northern Bering (NBS) and Chukchi (CS) Seas are the region of transition between the pacific and the arctic. Sea ice extent and the timing of the ice retreat (TSR) is key to determine the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom, which in turn impacts fish communities differently as a result of varying thermal and prey preferences.

Methods:
- Bottom trawl samples are from the T/S Oshoro-maru in 1990-1997,2007-2009, and 2013. Timing varied year to year. Fish densities were calculated based on distance (area swept).
- TSR: last date when sea ice concentration was below 50% at each sampling station prior to the minimum sea ice concentration. This was taken from SSMI data.
- Fish were grouped by zoogeography: Arctic, Mainly Arctic, Arctic-boreal, Mainly Boreal, and Boreal. Densities were 4th root transformed and multi-linear regressions were done between each group and bottom temp, TSR, and sampling data.
- Cluster analysis was done on bray-curtis dissimilarities, and permanova to identify environmental factors by community.

Results
- Dominant species were walleye pollock (Boreal), Bering flounder (Arctic-boreal), and Arctic cod (Arctic). pollock were generally restricted to the NBS, though they were present near bering strait in some years.
- Arctic and Arctic-boreal species appear to dominate the western side of St. Lawrence. As you move north, biomass decreases as the community becomes driven by smaller gadids, flatfishes, and sculpins
- Of all of the environmental parameters, TSR was the most important variable, serving as an indicator of environmental conditions during a specific year, which bottom temperature is more representative of the short-term environmnent, and thus TSR may have a more direct linkage to community composition.

Because of the association with spawning and feeding traits of some species, TSR may affect the formation and maintenance of the community without direct effects of water temperature.
