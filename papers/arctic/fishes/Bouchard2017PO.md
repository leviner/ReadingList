## Significance:
Analysis of the impact of ice retreat timing and SST on the success of B. saida in the Canadian Beaufort over a 10 year period of sampling.  Describe the positive correlations between hatcher success and SST/early ice retreat.

## Notes:
SST has been increasing in the Arctic, with sea ice extent and volume declining.  B. saida almost exclusively occupy the role between zooplankton and higher trophic levels.  Factors influencing the early survival dictate the surviving recruits to the adult population.  Large winter spawning that leads to summer hatching, and thus warmer temperatures and higher food abundance results in faster growth.  They hypothesize that early sea ice breakup and high spring/summer SST promote recruitment, and whether this is due to higher survival or faster summer growth.

Samples were collected from 2005-2015 on acoustic trawl surveys between august and October. Ice concentration is satellite derived. Icthyoplankton nets were used to sample larval. Juvenile fish in the epipelagic layer. Otoliths were used for aging, and EK60 data was used to make abundance and biomass estimates using db differencing and a TS-Length relationship (Geoffroy et al., 2016).

Over the sampling period, ice breakup occurred progressively earlier, and mean SST increased.  The density of age-0 A. cod in the epipelagic layer decreased with later ice breakup and increased with increasing spring-summer SST.  The SL of a. cod on August 6th increased as a function of earlier break up and increased SST, which was related to hatch date.  Biomass in the epipelagic layer increased as a function of earlier ice break up and increasing spring-summer SST. Ice breakup week explained 63% of biomass variations in August and 65% in September.

Future predictions:
- Earlier ice break up will increase the SL in august by 5-12mm, and increase the biomass in the epipelagic layer by 2.7 in 2050.

The match/mismatch hypothesis states that early growth and survival depend on sychronized development of the larvae of their plankton food.  In A. cod, the largest prewinter sizes result from the winter refuge theory (early hatching in warm water) allowing fish to feed longer and gain greater length and biomass to increase overwinter survival.

These results match the idea that maximizing prewinter size rather than ensuring a match with planktonic food is the driving force behind A. cod reproductive strategy.  The survival of early hatchers is enhanced in years of early ice break up and warmer conditions.  

Length is most strongly correlated to hatch date, and early ice breakup improves the survival of early hatchers.  In addition, advanced phytoplankton blooms, hastening of copepoed nauplii production, and greater light availability all improve the survival of early hatchers due to early ice retreat.  The weakening of these associations observed in October are likely due to the movement of these fish out of the epipelagic layer, not a loss of biomass in the entire water column.

**They suggest that biomass is the best integrator of environmental effects due to the combination of abundance and size/weight"**

Increased temperature and earlier retreat may have little negative impacts in the immediate future, improving juvenile recruitment in the fall by increasing survival of these earlier hatchers.  However, there may be a threshold at which earlier melt becomes detrimental to survival, either due to a disruption of phytoplankton and hence zooplankton growth, or a shrinking of the thermally available habitat for the age1+ fish.  Borealization by other forage fish due to increased temperature will also lead to more resource competition.
