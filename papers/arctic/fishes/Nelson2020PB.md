## Title:
Circumpolar genetic population structure of polar cod, Boreogadus saida
## Keywords:
arctic cod, population genetics, biogeography, divergence
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Observations of genetic differentiation of Arctic cod populations between Canada West, Canada East, Europe, and US regions, with differences in within-region homogeneity. Genetic diversity may largely be driven by physical barriers to transport and heterogeneity is directly correlated to distance.

## Notes:
Emerging studies of the ecology and physiology of arctic cod include behavior and transport of individuals and schools which may have implications for genetic structure and population connectivity. Northward range shifts may replace populations, or lead to an influx of genes that potentially change the adaptability of these fish to changing temperature and ice conditions. By identifying genetically explicit populations, management, monitoring, and assessment of these distinct populations will be possible. In the Beaufort Sea, previous work has found small-scale partitioning using mitochondrial DNA. Here, they use microsatellite markers to look at genetic differentiation across larger spatial scales.

2600 fish from 19 locations across the Arctic collected between 2004 and 2011 were genotyped at 10 microsatellite locations. Initially Arctogadus was removed from a single marker to ensure only boreogadus saida was included in further analysis. Form these, 300 fish were removed.

Used a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components to identify groupings and associations by site
- Clear separation by large-scale zones: canada east, canada west, us, and europe
- Samples form Hudson strait did not associate within the canada east area
- Geographical distance and Fst were significantly correlated
- Within group sampling, only two pairs showed significant difference in Fst: Bonavista and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in comparison with Baffin bay.
- Between regions, all but 9 pairwise tests of Fst were significantly different

Findings:
- Genetic differentiation was detected across the Arctic
- Significant gene flow is likely due to passive migration and dispersal in the larval stage which have been observed based on otoliths, though direct pathways have yet to be observed.
- Four significant groups were found, but there was a major break between the canada east and the other 3, which may be explained by the significant homogenization of the population within the region but lack of introduction from outside. "along the route taken by the prevailing currents from east to west Greenland there exists a barrier to migration of adults or passive transport of eggs and larvae."
- The European group similarly shows homogeneity across the region, this may be due to relative distance of sampling locations
- In the western Arctic, a divide was found between the US and Canada West groups. This is believed to be due to the restriction of passive transport due to the Mackenzie plume which leads to a genetic divergence of the two populations.
- Distinctions between Canada east and west suggests that the archipelago may be a barrier.
