## Significance:
De Robertis et al. conducted a trawl selectivity experiment using recapture nets on a modified-Marinovich trawl to asses the species- and size-specific selectivity.  There is significant escapement, even for the most abundant species, and this analysis is required to properly calculate biomass/abundance estimates for juvenile Arctic cod.

## Notes:
Selectivity is different depending on the panel of the net and the size of the animal.

P<sub>i</sub> = sum(c<sub>s,i</sub>/f<sub>s,i</sub>)/ sum<sub>i</sub>(c<sub>s,i</sub>/f<sub>s,i</sub>)

P is the proportion of individuals escaping from partition i, where c is the number of individuals as stations s caught in partition i, and f is the fraction of the meshes covered by the recapture net.

P<sub>i</sub> was bootstrapped using a random selection of trawls (with replacement).

Mean fish lengths were slightly larger in the codend then the recapture nets.

Following Williams et al 2015,

r<sub>l</sub> = (1 + exp<sup>k(L<sub>50</sub> - 1)/SR</sup> -1)

Where  r<sub>l</sub> is the probability that a fish of length l entering the net is retained in the codend, L<sub>50</sub> is the length at which 50% of the fish are retained, SR is the length in cm between the 25% and 75% retention

Concluding hypotheses
* Escapement is strongly species and size specific, and varies by section in the trawl
* Sand lance and arctic cod are the most common
