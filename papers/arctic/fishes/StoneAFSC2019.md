## Significance:
AFSC Age and Growth Program report on Arctic cod growth rates and criteria for ageing using otoliths.

## Notes:
Arctic cod are relatively fast-growing and short-lived, having been observed at a maximum age of 7-8 though typically rarely encountered >4. It is federally managed in U.S. zones though not currently commercially targeted.

Current Age determination methods:
- Because of their short life spans, there is typically a clear surface pattern in Arctic cod otoliths and age determination can be done successfully with only a dissecting microscope while submerging the otolith in water.
- If the surface pattern is not clear, a "break-and-bake" method can be used to enhance the clarity of the bands.

The size of the first strong mark is variable and so placement of the "1" mark can be difficult and ambiguous. In otoliths with a clear annual mark, it is common to see a smaller mark between it and the center, and it is unclear whether these small marks should be counted as annual marks when they range from weak/moderate to absent. Additional information is needed to identify if these small marks near the center are in fact annual marks, such as stable isotope ratios. Preliminary studies found that the O18 peaks do not always correspond to the regions of annual marks on otoliths even if the number of peaks matches the number of marks.

At AFSC A&G, only strong marks >0.8 mm in radius are counted as annual marks, and weak or moderate marks near the core are recorded but not counted. These specimen are flagged based on the strength of the center mark in case they need to be revisited.
