## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
07/01/2010 - 08/30/2019
## Significance:
Observations of shifting pollock distribution into the northern Bering Sea during recent warming (2017 - 2019).

## Notes:
In the Bering, climate driven shifts due to warming of previously-cold-dominated ecosystems have been observed for Pacific cod, halibut, and pollock. Pollock are a key ecological and economic fish stock.

During cold years and the formation of the cold pool on the Bering shelf, adult pollock are typically located on the outer shelf, and spread eastward in warmer years, as adult stock tend to avoid the cold pool. These warm-cold oscillations have been typical in recent decades, though the past few years have been anomalously warm with significantly less sea ice in winter, and just prior to this warming period adult pollock had been observed in the northern reaches of the Bering.

Changes in summer may be due to the cold pool reduction, which served as a barrier for migrating adults, and less ice formation means less motivation to migrate south. Typically, the cold pool also serves to spatially separate adult and age-1 pollock, who do not migrate and stay in the cold pool. As a result of the current warming, they are looking to address:
1. How do adult and age-1 pollock distributions vary between 2010 (cold) and 2017-2019 (warm)?
2. How does the environment influence the summer adult and age-1 distributions?
3. How do the age-size structures differ between the US and Russian pollock collections?

Methods:
- Bottom trawl surveys in 2010, 2017, 2018, and 2019 in the SE, NE, and NW Bering
- CTDs and headrope loggers used for bottom depth temperatures
- NSIDC ice data
- Bottom currents from output of a ROMS based on reanalysis products.

Results:
- Low sea ice extent in 17/18/19, with very little ice in Anadyr in 2018
- Cold pool extension to the south in 2010 and 2017, though temperatures were particularly warm in the inner shelf in 17/18/19
- Flow: difference between 17 and 19 was the strong flow on the east side of St. Lawrence in 2019 (inner shelf) in spring

Pollock distributions:
- In 2010, pollock were in highest concentrations in the outer shelf. In 2017, they were more widespread across the shelf, including high concentration in the north. In 2018 the distribution was patchy, with high concentrations just south of Bering Strait and along the outer shelf. In 2019, concentrations were high along most of the outer and middle shelf as well as just south of Bering Strait.

Reaffirms previous observations that in cold years, adult pollock are constrained to the outer shelf, limited by bottom water temperatures. There appears to be more mixing of the Russian stock as the adult population moves north and east.

"At present there are comparatively few records of early-stage pollock larvae being collected in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas so it seems unlikely that northern colonization on a large scale has occurred." Of those that have been collected, it appears more likely that they have been transported there rather than locally produced. Connectivity between spawning sites and the northern Chukchi Sea has not been shown, though connectivity to northern regions is possible and age-0 pollock could reach the northern Bering with favorable transport conditions in 4-6 weeks.

They question whether the pollock observed recently in the southern Chukchi will be able to colonize the region, depending on temperature tolerance, prey resources, reproductive requirements, and predation pressure.

Hypotheses
- In 2017, pollock moved north and stayed farther north than normal over winter, remained there in summer 2018, and some adults moved south in 2018/2019.
- The Increased air and SS temps in the NW Bering in winter 2018 prohibited the formation of the cold pool. Weak stratification led to a weaker Navarin current, and a stronger northward stream on the eastern shelf developed.
- In warm years, pollock stocks may be more mixed between US and Russia than in cold years due to the earlier timing of feeding migration.
