## Title:
The effect of oceanographic variability on the distribution of larval fishes of the northern Bering and Chukchi seas
## Keywords:
arctic cod, larvae, chukchi, habitat, climate change
## Geographic Coverage:
Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
08/01/2007 - 10/01/2012
## Significance:
Comparison of key larval fishes in 2012 and 2013 to environmental conditions, hyputhesizing that fishes have evolved spawn timing and location such that larvae can handle interannual variations in conditions

## Notes:
Here, they compare they spatial distribution of fish larvae (bongo nets) in 2012 and 2013 Arctic EIS surveys and mapped the distributios relative to the water masses and their environmental and biological (i.e., zooplankton) conditions.

Four key taxa that were most abundant in the net samples were capelin, Arctic cod, Bering flounder, and yellowfin sole. Pollock eggs were only caught in the northern Bering. For context, there were 532 total eggs and 264 individuals caught in the chukchi in 2012, and 337 and 150 in 2013.
- Eggs: Bering flounder-  northern Chukchi, Hannah Shoal region, yellowfin sole, southern Chukchi, south kotzebue sound region
- In both 2012 and 2013, Arctic cod ichthyoplankton were highest in the northern and northeast Chukchi. Yellowfin sole and capelin were in higher densities in the southern Chukchi and northern Bering.
- Arctic cod only appeared to be present in the Chukchi Winter Water and Anadyr/Bering/Chukchi Summer Water mix in both years. Yellowfin sole and capelin were more abundant where the Alaska Coastal Water was the surface condition, but non-depth stratified sampling makes it impossible to tell where in the water column the fishes were.
- This A/B/C water mix and the CWW had higher biomass of copepods

 There was a wind-driven change in the water mass distribution between years but "There were no statistically significant differences between 2012 and 2013 in the distributions of Arctic cod, Bering flounder, yellowfin sole and capelin larvae."

 They suggest that the location of the fish (the specific water masses larvae are found within) is a function of their spawning ground and the advective processes that move them on the shelf. Given that Arctic cod spawn in late winter, you would expect to see them further north on the shelf. Arctic cod and flounder were not found in the coastal water, likely because they are expected to spawn in shelf waters and thus are retained in it.

 The size of larval Arctic cod align with what was expected, given the potential timing of spawning and the modeling of Vestfals et al.
