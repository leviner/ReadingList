## Title:
Multi-scale temporal variability in biological-physical associations in the NE Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
Arctic cod, wavelets, zooplankton, moorings, observatory
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
09/09/2014 - 09/01/2019
## Significance:
Temporal patterns and coherence among physical and biological variables at the Chukchi Ecological Observatory using acoustic and oceanographic moorings.

## Notes:
Here, they use time-scale decomposition of a series of biological and environmental metrics to look at scales/periods of variation in the density and vertical distribution of fishes and zooplankton. The goal is to investigate biological responses to changing climate.

Methods:
- Observations collected at the Chukchi Ecosystem Observatory on the southeastern side of Hanna Shoal.
- Physical environment
  - Near bottom and midwater CTDs
  - Sea ice concentration (daily averages) from NSIDC
  - Solar inclination 
  - Air temperatures recorded in Utqiagvik
  - Wind conditions from CCCS
- Acoustic Data
  - AZFP deployed between 28 and 35 meters each year, upward facing at 38, 2125, 200, and 455 kHz
  - 1 Ping every 15 minutes
  - Zooplankton and fish were determined based on delta MVBS at 125 and 38 kHz, with a threshold of -70
  - Fish backscatter was assumed to be primarily Arctic cod across the time series
- Data analysis
  - Vertical distribution using echometrics following Urmy et al., 2012: mean Sv, MWD, intertia (dispersion), aggregation (patchiness).
  - Wavelet analysis
    - Results are presented as scalograms, using continuous wavelets (as presented in Urmy thesis and Gonzalez et al., 2019)
    - Wavelet coherency was used to pair the biological and environmental temporal patterns, as well as between the fish and zooplankton decompositions

Results
- Backscatter from fish and zooplankton were present year round, with greater densities in summer than winter. Peak densities occurred between July and September for Fish and August - November for zooplankton.
- Both groups were deeper in winter, ascending around February, and reaching depths close to the surface by the end of summer (Note from RML: interesting dynamic and I think in general this is true but within the summer there appears to be deepening in the CM plots).
- Peak fish/zooplankton lasted longer in 2017 than other years, concurrent with the warmest temperatures in the series.
- Temporal variability
  - Most variability in fish and zooplankton metrics were based around the 1-year time period, indicating strong intra-annual variations, 3 month seasonal time period, with a strong diel peak as well.
- Coherence between fish and zooplankton was strong at a 1-year period, with 2.5 month, 1 month, and 11 days with variable lag.
- Coherence between biology and environment (see Table 1 for complete details):
  - Highest peaks in diel signal occurred in periods of intermediate daylight (spring and autumn, strongest in autumn). Diel cycle in dispersion was strongest in autumn.
  - Wind and CoM/Sv were associated on a 1-month time scale
  - Overall, water temperature, sea ice concentration, and light radiation appeared to be the most important factors in association with the biological parameters.

Summary/Discussion
- Evidence of year-round DVM, stronger in the fish than zooplankton: "Age-0 polar cod is the most abundant species in the NE Chukchi Sea during summer (De Robertis et al. 2017) and can also be reasonably expected to be dominant under the sea ice in winter"
- They report an absence of DVM by fish during summer at CEO
- Coherence between zooplankton and fish could be the result of acoustic misclassification, fish preying on a subset of zooplankton, and/or common responses to environmental drivers rather than interaction (Note from RML: I interpret this as co-occurrence within water masses and sources).
- Variability in fish and zooplankton vertical distributions along 14 and 28-day periods could be the result of the lunar cycle exacerbating/reducing migration to avoid visual predation. Shorter period (4-12 days) in winter could be intermittent rest/feeding behaviors.
- Salinity and wind coherence with zoop/fish on a 3-4 week lag could be due to overturning and mixing of deep water, leading to periodic blooms and thus increased short term productivity.
- Seasonality (3-month associations) are aligned with the temporal pattern in sea ice concentration, which in turn is responsible for ice algae and zoplankton production.
- Associations between water mass and fishes/zooplankton are mostly linked during the late-spring to fall period of warming. Much of the vertical distribution is likely tied to stratification on the same scales.
- The "characterization of scale-dependent temporal patterns" can be used for management purposes and designing proper assessment strategies in the region, as well as create pan-Arctic comparisons.
