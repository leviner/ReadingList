## Title:
Ichthyoplankton of Russian Arctic Seas: 1. Polar cod Boreogadus saida
## Keywords:
boreogadus saida, larvae, juveniles, polar cod
## Geographic Coverage
Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea
## Field Dates:
08/31/2015 - 09/19/2017
## Significance:
Distribution and size composition of polar cod on the Russian Arctic seas from surveys conducted in 2015-2017.  Size increases as a function of season and latitude.

## Notes:
This is the first article in a series classifying the distribution of ichthyoplankton in the Russian Arctic seas.  Polar cod have a circumpolar distribution, consuming a wide variety for zooplankton prey, and serving as an important prey source for higher trophic levels.  High growth rate and assimilation efficiency at cold temperatures makes it an important link.

72 bongo net samples were used over 3 years across the three seas using oblique tows in the upper 40m of water, conducted both at night and during the day.  Caught ~10 individuals per sample.  No ice present at any point of this study.

2015 - August/September surveys found fish in the 18-47mm range, median between 28-36.  Max catches in the eastern Kara sea of 1-1.4 ind/m2 and surface temperatures of .5-2.7C and low salinity (26-29).

2016 - In early July/August surveys, larvae were 9-28mm, mean of 14.5mm, with 2-3 ind/m2, with very few individuals in water <25m depth.  Increase in average body length as you move offshore.

2017 - August/September, highest catches in Laptev Sea where there was little river runoff 1.8 ind/m2.

In all survey regions, there was a clear shallow warm/fresh layer from river runoff overlaying a cooler/saltier layer of offshore water.  The distribution of juveniles and larvae is highly patchy, with nonzero catches ranging from .5-10 ind/m2.  Unlike in the Barents Sea, the highest concentration of individuals were observed offshore above the continental slope, similar to observations in the Beaufort Sea.

The apparent decrease in body size moving north was probably due to ice edge retreat.  The further north, the later the hatching, and the slower the growth, though the abundance is higher.  This is most pronounced in areas of large estuaries where runoff raises the temperatures.

Decreased values nearshore could be due to a) natural moratlity, b) avoidance of fishing gear due to faster growth and thus increased size, and c) ontogenetic shift to benthos.  Mean length of fish decreased as they moved away from the river delta.  Temperature appears to be driving size, as samples from stations of the same latitude had much larger larvae in areas of surface water ~4c relative to cooler water near river output.
