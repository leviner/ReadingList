## Significance:
Interactions in the Barents Sea between atlantic cod, pelagic fish, and krill. Use of 3 different acoustic datasets to look at foraging and spatial distribution relationships with the diel cycle.

## Notes:
The most significant ecosystem interaction in the Barents is that between Atlantic cod, small pelagic fish, and krill. Cod is a top predator in the system, and is a visual predator. While generally found near the bottom it is opportunistic with a wide range of feeding behaviors. It's main prey is capelin but additionally feeds of boreogadus in the northern Barents during the ice-free period.

Because of the difficulty of observing fine-scale space use behavior in the pelagic zone, this interaction has previously not been well studied. Here, they use broadband acoustics in addition to trawl and stomach sampling to investigate the role of light in driving spatial interactions among these species.

Methods:
*Acoustics*
- Surveys were done on 2 days in the Barents Sea
- Cod were sampled with a demersal trawl, pelagic fish with a larger midwater trawl. All trawls were targeted on dense scattering layers and 5 trawls were conducted for each group. Demersal trawls were done for 15 minutes on bottom, and midwater until sensors indicated a sufficient catch size. Krill were kept from the samples and identified from fish stomachs. Total abundances by species and size class were determined using Stox software.
- Stomach contents from cod, arctic cod, and capelin were analyzed to identify feeding relationships and interactions. Feeding rates were adjusted based on calculated evacuation rates.
- EK60 data at 6 frequencies was collected throughout the survey.
- Broadband data using a 120 kHz transducer (operating from 95 to 160 kHz) was used on a probe system lowered over the side to maximize resolution, resulting in ~1cm bins.
- LSSS was used to identify single targets and detect fish tracks for cod
- Multifrequency data was used to look at the distribution of krill and pelagic fish.
- 18 kHz continuous data was used to monitor the degree of aggregation and dispersion during the diel cycle.
*Hydrography*
- CTD measurements were collected during only 1 cast over the two days, and was used to determine PAR throughout the water column.
- A ship-mounted light sensor was used to estimate surface radiation

Spatial associations and interactions between cod, pelagic fish, and krill follow diel cycles. Pelagic fish migrated closely with the light intensity, remaining within 50 m of the bottom during the day, and migrating along with krill at night. Pelagic fish were much more dispersed at night as expected. Cod stayed within 10m of the bottom but indicated more activity and vertical range in early morning than other times of the day. This activity corresponds with a higher proportion of fresh pelagic fish in cod stomachs, which declined significantly with hours since dawn. Pelagic fish avoided light intensities above 0.001 umol photons when ascending and responded to daylight by forming pelagic aggregations rather than descending. with the krill. The cod behavior is likely an optimization of foraging based on light levels and prey distribution. Based on empty stomach samples of capelin, the predation risk of being eaten by cod outweighs seeking krill.
