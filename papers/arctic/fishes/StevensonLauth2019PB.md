## Significance:
Comparison of the distribution of fish in the Eastern Bering Sea during cold and warm periods based on groundfish surveys.

## Notes:
The variability in sea ice formation and temperatures in the Bering Sea affects the biomass and species composition of zooplankton and fish recruitment. Recently, the region has been experiencing longer multi-years stanzas of cold and warm conditions. They analyze the trends from 2002 to 2017 in temperatures and species distributions. They then compare two years of surveys from 2010 and 2017 during the cold and warm periods to look at impact in the distribution and abundance of organisms.

Catches were standardized to CPUE in kg/swept area, bottom temperatures were recorded from a headrope logger, and they calculated latitudinal trends by looking at center of gravity of species distributions.

Bottom temperatures showed 3 periods relative to mean, with a warm period from 2002 - 2005, then a cool period until 2014. The major differences between 2010 and 2017 were the extent of the cold pool on the inner shelf where it was greatly reduced.

Total biomass, particularly of pollock has varied between 2.3 and 8 million tons during the study period. The geographic center of biomass for pollock was farther east in warm years than in cold years. In the warmer period (2017), pollock biomass was more concentrated on the inner/middle shelf. In colder years those concentrations were on the outer shelf and shelf break.

Pacific cod showed a north/south difference between warm and cold years, with fish concentrated in the northern middle shelf in warmer conditions. Rock sole concentrations were relatively stable and concentrated in the southeast survey area. The geographic center of the jellyfish population was generally further north in warm years.

Latitudinal distribution in CPUE showed a similar peak in biomass in the mid-latitudes of the survey, with catch diverging north of 62, where in 2017 a second peak occurred at the highest latitudes while catches continued to decline further north in 2010. Across the shelf, fish accounted for a greater proportion of the catch totals in 2017 vs 2010, with less decline into the northern portion in warmer years.

In cold years, it appears that highly mobile species such as pollock and pacific cod avoid the cold pool, and thus in warmer years when the cold pool is restricted these fish are found further north.
