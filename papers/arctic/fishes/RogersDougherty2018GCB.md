## Significance:
Overview of how pollock spawning timing has shifted over cold and warm periods in the Gulf of Alaska.

## Notes:
Spawning phenology is sensitive to temperature, however this effects vary across species and stocks. Other factors such as demographic structure can influence phenology, as larger fish tend to spawn earlier and over a longer duration. Change in the spawning population structure can be due to evolutionary change or human impacts such as fishing pressure on a portion of the spawning stock.

Larval data from EcoFOCI cruises has been collected since 1979, with larvae sampled using paired bongo nets. For determining hatch dates:
- An age-length regression (linear model) was developed for each year using otolith analysis of a subsample of larvae
- Ages of all fish were assigned based on the station-specific catches
- Hatch dates were back calculated from age and sampling day
- Mortality rates were estimated using a mortality curve of instantaneous mortality as a function of age
- Spawning dates were estimated from temperature-dependent egg development rates as determine from lab experiments

Age structure of the spawning population was used from the acoustic-trawl midwater survey in Shelikof Strait (when available).

They report evidence of climate and population demographic impacts on phenology. Age structure and water temperature altered the duration of the spawning season, where when temperatures were high and/or the spawning stock was older, spawning started earlier and lasted longer. While there was a strong impact in cold years (late spawning) warm years showed little variation relative to the long-term average.

Older large females may be disproportionately important for recruitment. Early and longer spawning periods ensure that the larval fish are hatching over a long temporal window which may be advantageous in highly variable environments. This would also lead to increased geographic range of larvae, increasing the spatial distribution of offspring.
