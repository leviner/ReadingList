Study of larval fish ecology of Arctic cod, describing timing and sizes of larval phases.

## Notes:
Arctic cod were collected in Resolute Bay (Canadian Beaufort), and transported to Vancouver aquarium for rearing.  Fish were kept in 1C conditions.  Fish spawned after 5-6 months in captivity, and gametes were then retained in a floating mesh container and sampled throughout the study.  Spawning is possibly sensitive to the arctic light/dark cycle.

Eggs range from 1.5-1.9mm, floated at or near (<10cm) the surface.  Hatching times are highly temperature dependent:
- 1.5C: 58 days. minimum deformities or mortality
- One year, water was at 2C for 43 days then rose to 9C for 24 hours before hatching at 44 days.  Massive mortality occurred.

Hatch to about 5-6 mm in length.  Once hatched, the yolk sac is large enough to impede swimming.  Yolk nutrition lasted 20-40 days.  Fish attempted to feed immediately after hatching (will feed when food is available) but improved as swimming improved.

Larvae remain near surface.  At 95 days, larvae near surface were larger than those near bottom (possibly lack of feeding).  In the wild, currents would likely broaden the depth distribution.  The large yolk sac and thus poor swimming but the need to feed immediately points to thee fish needing to be collocated with an abundant food source early in life.
