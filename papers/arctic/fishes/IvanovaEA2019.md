## Title:

## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Significance:
Investigated the movement of Arctic cod in resolute bay during the presence and absence of cruise ships, found behavioral changes (less feeding, more directed swimming).

## Notes:
Decadal scale decrease in sea ice is leading to an increase in vessel traffic , which has doubled over the last 20 years. This is expected to continue to increase, further increasing the acoustic noise in the Arctic, with potential ecological implications along the northwest passage. There are currently no reports of acoustic noise impacts on Arctic fishes. Changes in distribution of Arctic cod as a result of increased ship traffic may have cascading impacts for ecosystems. Identification of behaviors and subsequent changes in those behaviors as a result of vessels is necessary to evaluate future impacts of shipping increases.

They measured sound from a cruise ship and used it to estimate the vessel noise from other similar ships passing through Resolute Bay determined via AIS. Arctic cod (mean length of 19.9 cm) were caught via hook-and-line and tagged with Vemco acoustic tags for use with a 60-receiver array of receivers deployed in the bay. Position was used to quantify home ranges for 77 fishes during periods of vessel presence, vessel absence, and vessel movement.

Cod behavior was determined for "bursts" of continuous samples received. The fuzzy clustering "fanny" method was used to cluster patterns into three movement types using sum of distance, mean rate of movement, variance of distance, mean turn angle, and variance in bearing.

Arctic cod home range (kernel utilization distribution) shifted from the nw to the ne of the bay when vessels were present. Mean individual home ranges were not significantly different between absent and present, though overall the area used was reduced. Three distinct movement patterns were classified: foraging/searching , feeding and in transit. These movement patterns were significantly different between present and absent, with searching decreasing and travelling increasing with ships present.

One thing they did not measure is depth, so it is unclear if fish were diving or transiting across the bay, though horizontal distributions did change. Fish appear to be more cautious in high noise, being less exploratory with vessels present. This switch in behavior patterns may also have implications for the energetics of individuals (less feeding, more fleeing). There is a possibility, though it is unclear from this study, or noise acclimation, as exhibited in other fishes.
