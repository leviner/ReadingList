## Significance:
Analysis of diets in co-occurring Arctic cod, haddock, and Atlantic cod, showing minimal diet overlap, even with variability between fjord and ice-edge conditions.

## Notes:
Community structure and distribution can be altered by changing climate conditions thus impacting ecosystem function. Though studies on Arctic cod have shown flexibility in habitat demands, they are likely vulnerable to changes in prey, predator, and competitor abundances on the Arctic continental shelves. Adult Atlantic cod and haddock have expanded their ranges into the Barents as spawning locations have moved with warming conditions, and are now being caught near Svalbard. Competition could result in displacement or habitat segregation. Here they look at diet overlap to look at long-term impacts to Arctic cod.

Fish were collected in open water and under sea ice in both coastal and fjord areas using benthic and pelagic trawling. Under ice fish were collected in 2009 by divers. Juvenile gadids ere measures and stomachs were separated and contents ID's. For long-term diet trends, stable nitrogen isotope analysis was done on muscle samples.

Diets
- Polar Cod: calanus dominated, along with themisto amphipods, particularly at the ide edge and under ice. Ice edge and fjord fish had low overlap. Benthic diets were typically more variable than the pelagic diets, though the similarities to pelagic fish may be due to movement between habitats.
- Haddock: appendicularians, along with euphausiids and themisto amphipods
- Atlantic cod: mostly euphausiids, with contributions from calanus and themisto

There was very little dietary overlap (<37%) between any species. Atlantic cod and Haddock had consistently different diets in all of the co-occurring samples. Polar cod had a significantly higher N-15 ratio than atlantic cod and haddock but not different than under ice polar cod, however this still indicates that their dietary niches may be stable. Isotopic signatures in atlantic cod and haddock were more similar to each other. Smaller polar cod are gap limited which restricts their diet, and larger decapods and gammarids were only found in larger benthic fish.  

It's possible that the different diets may be due to the co-occurrence of multiple gadids rather than preferred diet differences, or physiological/behavioral differences such as gape size, swim speed, detection ability.
