## Significance:
Early life history stages of Arctic and saffron cod in 2017, using trhe Vestfals 2021 model to replicate 2017 from the bottom trawl data.

## Notes:
The goals for the study were to 1) examine distributions and abundance of Arctic cod and saffron cod during ELH stages, 2) estimate daily growth rates, and 3) look at the potential sources using a individual based mofel to compare model outputs and observed distributions.

Samples were collected using a mix of bongo nets, IKMTs, and 3-m beam trawls on 4 different cruises during 2017. Catches were all normalised to CPUE (count per 10m2 of surface area). Growth rates were determined from the change in mean length during the median date of each survey and was gear-specific.

IBM were run based on the model from Vestfals et al., 2021, focussing on the Kotzebue sound spawning population as a result of the high density of ELH fishes found there during the late-spring survey.

Results for Arctic cod:
- In June, most fishes were found in Kotzebue/Point Hope, north of the strait (note, the survey did nto extend north of this).
- In late summer, the highest densities were found in the northern survey area near Hannah shoal and Barrow Canyon.
- Growth rate: 0.27 - 0.53 mm /day. pverall mean of 0.39 mm/day (note Levine et al., 2021 reported 0.54 with a range of 0.24 to 0.89 depending on target strength)

Saffron cod:
- Lower abundance relative to polar cod, with a core distribition in the south and inshore of Arctic cod
- In late summer, mostly found nearshore in the central/NE Chukchi.

IBM:
- Larvae with simulated hatch dates of 15 March to 15 May all show similar trajectories, remaining in the Kotzebue sound region and extending north along the coast in late spring. By late summer, this splits into two groups one that remained inshore along the coast line to the north and another branch of fishes advected offshore.

Kotzebue sound was covered in sea ice during the expetced period of hatch for fishe sin Kotzebue sound, thus sea ice may be important for both species. These fish were likely entrained in the ACC and avected northwards.

It is likely that indnividuals of mixed cohorts were present in the Chukchi Sea. Hatching occurred between January and May, with a peak in April. However there is also likely some sampling bias as the smallest individuals may not be properly retained thus biasing towards larger individuals in spring.

They conclude that Kotzebue sound is likely a major spawning area, however their distributions from the model do not match 2017 distributions from the midwater trawls.
