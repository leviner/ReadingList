## Notes:
The gulf of Alaska experienced a record heatwave from 2014 - 2016, leading to fishery impacts that continue in the Gulf of Alaska. Early life stages are particularly susceptible to environmental conditions and thermal stresses. Pacific cod migratory and spawning distributions are also strongly linked to temperature conditions, where thermal habitat plays a large role in Pacific cod behavior. Here, they look at hatch success of Pcod to see (H1) if Pcod have experienced major shifts in the timing, depth, and extent of spawning habitat, (H2) if Pcod spawning habitat was reduced during the warming event, and (H3) if Pcod spawning habitat is a predictor of recruitment success.

Methods
- Laboratory experiments were done to look at the affect of temperature on eggs. Daily egg mortality and hatch success were quantified.
- Spawning habitat index was calculated as seasonal and depth-specific suitability of spawning habitat based on the average hatch success across depths of 100 - 250 m from January to April using historical measurements from the GAK1 UAF line observations.
- The time series of fish came from a mix of observations. Icthyoplankton surveys were conducted biennially from 1981 to 2011 in the GoA. Age-0 fishes were targeted during seining surveys from 2006 to present. Mature recruitment (age-3) were taken from the GoA stock assessment.

Hatch success was highly temperature dependent, with the highest success between 3 and 7 degrees. Thermal habitat was available in most years, particularly in shallow regions < 50 m in early winter, increasing in depth between February to April. By May, surface waters are too warm. In 2015, 2016, and 2019 during temperature anomalies, habitat was reduced, with probability of hatch success being 57-59% that of average years.

Larval abundance was significantly correlated with habitat suitability. Age-3 abundance was also significantly correlated with a lag-1.

There is a relatively narrow thermal tolerance between 4-5C for Pcod eggs, which may reflect the stability of conditions in their typical environment. One mechanism of thermal limitation to recruitment is limiting reproductive potential as demonstrated here. There are other possible mechanisms such as metabolic changes that may further reduce output.
