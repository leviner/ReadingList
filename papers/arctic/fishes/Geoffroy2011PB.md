## Title:
The aggregation of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) in the deep Atlantic layer of ice-covered Amundsen Gulf (Beaufort Sea) in winter
## Keywords:
arctic cod, migration, predation
## Geographic Coverage
Western Canadian Arctic
## Field Dates:
10/18/2007 - 08/04/2008
## Significance:
Overwinter observations of vertical distribution of Arctic cod aggregations in the Canadian Beaufort, showing changes in depth distribution with water, light, and prey conditions.

## Notes:
Based on stomach's of marine mammals, it has been inferred that large winter aggregations of arctic cod occur in the canadian beaufort, and acoustic observations show the buildup of fish aggregations in Franklin Bay in early winter.

It is hypothesized that arctic cod occupy the deep pacific halocline to avoid predation from seals, where they become entrained and accumulate in the deep canyon.  Here, they test the hypothesis that the fish are entrapped in the pacific halocline in Amundsen Gulf.

Conducted regular CTD casts, use of a multinet to sample macrozooplankton, and EK60 hydroacoustic data collection at 38 and 120 kHz.

Db differencing was used to distinguish between fish and smaller scatterers, ranging between -5 and 4 dB for fish scatterers.  Biomass at depth was determined by TS-Weight relationships from Benoit et al., 2008.

Target strength was used to compare with previous estimates of A. cod target strength in lieu of trawling ability.  TS relationship from crawford and Jorgensen (1993) was used.  A similar analysis of target strengths was calculated on a collection of net validated acoustic data to confirm.

Water Masses
- The Pacific mixed layer was defined by the -1.6C isotherm from mid-december to late April, after which heating up to .5C and decreased salinity was observed.
- The  pacific halocline was from 60-200m depth and temperatures between -1.6 and 0, with warmer temperatures at depth.
- The atlantic layer had warmer temperatures (>0C) and high salinity (>34.6) from 200m to bottom

Sea ice and fish
- First fish aggregation occured right after the formation of ice, and the last shoal was detected just before breakup.
- Maximum fish densities were recorded in February and March
- Mesozooplankton biomass was greatest in the shallow PML in summer and the deep AL in winter.
- Fish wer emostly in the AL, extending up into the deep PH
- In April, fish extended shallower in the water column, corresponding with the vertical migration of mesozooplankton from the AL to PH

A. cod make up the observed aggregations based on TS analysis, similar to previous observations of validated targets.  Based on the TS distributions, it can be assumed that Franklin Bay and Amundsen Gulf share similar length distributions of A. cod.  Contrary to Benoit et al., 2008, less dense aggregations were observed in Amundsen Gulf than in Franklin Bay.  This supports the interpretation of local buildup of fishes in Franklin Bay and other embayment of Amundsen Gulf where bathymetry and depth-keeping behavior support aggregation formation.

The vertical distribution of A> cod corresponded with the depth of their zooplankton prey.  Smaller fish possibly venture into the PH at night to search from smaller prey on the periphery of the aggregation.

A. cod show a strong preference for warm and prey-rich  AL waters, avoiding freezing temperatures of shallower waters.  In Franklin Bay, the AL does not extend into the shallow areas, so fish were found in the deep PH layer.
- They hypothesize that entrainment into shallower areas may force fish out of their preferred thermal range

AT the end of winter, breakup of the dense aggregations may be due to the movement and availability of prey in shallower waters and the shortage of prey at depth.

aggregations appear to deepen with increasing light in early spring, possibly due to predator avoidance behavior in order to reduce predation from diving ringed seals in the region.  In addition to accelerated development for eggs and larvae, ice helps to limit the light penetration, reducing visual predation.  However entrapment in shallow conditions in Franklin Bay leaves these fish to be susceptible to increased predation.
