## Title:

## Significance:
Study of the temperature and pre-dependence of fatty acid composition and density in polar and saffron cod, showing strong association of polar cod and calanus in the Chukchi and divergent patterns in lipid density between age-0 and age-1+ fish of both species.

## Notes:
Juvenile fish have to balance between energy allocation for immediate growth and long-term storage. In the seasonal extremes of the Arctic, energy allocation strategies are different from those described in the temperate regions.

There are also ontogenetic changes in lipid density and composition, found in saffron cod to increase in density during the age-0 period but not during age-1+. The goal of this work was to look at size-dependent lipid allocation and understand the spatial differences observed in lipid biomarkers. This includes working with both lab-reared specimen and field samples.

Tissue collections:
- Fish were reared at 3 and 7C, sampled for length, weight and total lipids were measured at late juvenile stage
- Cod field samples came from four surveys in 2013 and 2014, both from shelf habitat and nearshore off of Barrow
- Total lipids and lipid classes were collected with thin layer chomatography (see Copeman et al., 2017)
- Zooplankton samples collected during the AEIS program with a 60 cm bongo net, calanus in subsamples were identified to stage

Growth potential was spatially determined using the survey temperatures from the 2012 and 2013 AIES program and based on Laurel et al. 2017.

Results
- Length but not temp has a significant impact on wet weight in lab samples at both temperatures, and lab fish were significantly heavier than fish from the field. Lipid density of lab fish was not affected by temperature, only length.
- When controlled for the effect of length, saffron cod had a higher wet mass than polar cod.
- Size explained 75% of the variation in lipid density and 99% of the variation in weight.
- Total lipids per wet weight were greater for polar cod than saffron cod
- In both species, lipid density increases with length in age-0 fish then decreases in age 1+
- Proportions of calanus derived fatty acids were higher in polar cod, and PUFA lipids higher in saffron cod
- Spatially, temperature-dependent growth potential for saffron cod was highest along the coast in the ACC, while Arctic cod growth rate was maximum in the offshore waters surrounding Cape Lisburne

Summary
- Significant intraspecific and ontogenetic difference in the lipid storage of polar cod and saffron cod
  - Age 0 polar cod: isometric growth, allometric storage, with temperature increasing size at age but not lipid density, thus changes across the Chukchi are a combination of both food and temperature and not temperature alone
- Similarities in spatial pattern of polar cod lipid density, calanus density, and calanus biomarkers indicate that calanus are key for determining food quality for age-0 polar cod
- The fatty acids indicate distinct diet differences with polar cod having a greater dependence on calanus, though some portion of the differences between saffron and polar cod is likely also due to differences in lipid-class proportions in their tissue
- The conidition of each species diverged spatially, which emphasizes the need for cold-water and calanus-based feeding regions for polar cod
