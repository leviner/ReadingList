## Title:
Mitochondrial genome diversity and population mitogenomics of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and Arctic dwelling gadoids
## Keywords:
arctic cod, genetic diversity, gadiformes, mitochondria
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea, Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Mitogenomics show high diversity and are inconclusive as to whether temperature or food availability may drive mitochondrial evolution, showing arctic cod may be capable of responding to changing climate.

## Notes:
Despite its large distribution, Arctic (polar) cod are relatively stenothermic compared with subarctic gadids (saffron cod and pollock) which thrive in warmer temperatures.  This may have negative consequences for species success in a warming arctic, particularly as smaller fish where their cold-adapted growth is not an advantage.

Mitochondiral genomes are key for ATP and heat production, and believed to be adapted to local climate conditions. Genetic diversity in the mitogenome may be greatly influenced by changes in the environment and thus directly impact species fitness in changing conditions.

Methods:
- Fin clips and muscle samples from Aleutians, Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort
- Mitogenomes were sequenced, assembled, and verified
- estimates (1) genetic differentiation by temperature region based on seas surface temperatures and (2) demographic history (were genes retained due to non-random selection)

There was minimal variability within species with two exceptions: GoA saffron cod varied significantly from the Bering/Chukchi, and Beufort pollock were different from the Aleutian/Bering samples, though there was a mix in the Beaufort/Chukchi. Within polar cod and pollock the northern regions showed higher nucleotide diversity than the southern regions. For most genes, there appeared to be significant selection.

"Gadid species included in this study showed little within-species geographic structure within the mitogenome from the Aleutian Islands to the Beaufort Sea." The lack of genetic diversity may support the hypothesis that boreal fish such as pollock are able to spawn in cold northern waters, or that it has been too recent of a transition for them to develop changes in their mitogenome.

The large population of arctic cod likely helps to maintain a high level of genetic diversity ad may represent the admixture of multiple groups/lineages as a result of changing sea level, currents, and subpopulations in the Arctic.
