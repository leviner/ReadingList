## Title:
Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) hatching season and growth rates in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas
## Keywords:
juvenile, growth, age, otolith
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
09/20/2012 - 09/01/2017
## Significance:
Estimations of growth and hatch rates of Arctic cod in the Chukchi Sea, indicates that larger individuals begin to settle to the seafloor on deeper portions of the shelf.

## Notes:
There are two hatch patterns found in Canaidan and European populations:
- short event that occurs with the ice break up in May to June
- extended period under ice beginning in winter and extending into late spring and summer
The tradeoff is that early hatching can gain greater pre winter size but have higher cumulative mortality during the extended larval period, while late hatching may experience greater overwinter mortality.

Five regions: NBS, SCS, NCS, W Beafort, and EBS. Samples were from five surveys conducted between 2012 and 2017 (AEIS, AIERP [ASGARD and AIESII], AMBON, and summer Beaufort transboundary surveys) using IKMT, PBST, Marinovich, Canadian BT, and bongo nets

Ototliths were aged twince to ensure consistency. Hatch dates were estimated by first estimating the age-at-length relationship from the otolith readings, assuming a linear relationship between age and length. Daily growth increments were averaged as a linear function of length by region. Age distributions for each region were simulated, using 10 random ages for each observed length. Essentially, they bootstrapped until they had 10000 individuals for the model. They bootstrapped the distributions of hatch dates to calculate the confidence intervals.

177 individuals were examined. Differences in length distribution by region were confounded by the sampling timing. Length as a function of age (slope) were consistent across regions but the intercepts differed.

Peak hatching was from January to May, with mean hatch date earliest for demersal fish caught in summer (January). 

Estimated growth rates in the northern Chukchi ranged from 0.081 to 0.215 mm d-1 for summer caught fishes.

The hatching they find is consistent with the likely patterns of spawning near or south of Bering Strait based on the age, preferred conditions, and known advection.
