## Title:
Distribution and diet of demersal Arctic Cod, Boreogadus saida, in relation to habitat characteristics in the Canadian Beaufort Sea
## Keywords:
biomass, prey, diet, habitat
## Geographic Coverage
Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
08/01/2012 - 08/30/2012
## Significance:
Cross-slope sampling of Arctic cod in the Canadian Beaufort shows differentiation in diet and size.

## Notes:
They conducted a series of cross-slope transects in the Canadian Beaufort to look at the relative biomass of Arctic cod across depth strata, associations with bottom habitat and water mass, and variability in diet across those habitats and masses.

Fish were collected via benthic trawling at predefined stations at 20-40, 75, 200, 350, 500, 750, and 1000 m depth. Nets were deployed for 20-min bottom time at 2.7 - 3.1 knots. Fish were sorted at sea with Arctic cod for diet analysis frozen. Measurements of biomass were based on CPUE. Physical properties collected with  CTD measurements at 1m intervals at each fishing station.

Results:
- CPUE was highest at the 350 and 500m depths, with standard length increasing with station depth, particularly crossing the 200m depth threshold. These depths sit at or below the Pacific-Atlantic thermohalocline.
- Beyond 500 m warmer temperatures and high higher saline conditions of the Atlantic water mass, followed by Arctic conditions at ~1000 m
- There were five diet groups:
  - Calanus glacialis
  - Larger copepods, e.g., hyperboreus
  - Larger thermisto (amphipods)
  - Mixed large copepods and amphipods
  - Smaller thermisto species
- There were not significant changes across transects but rather with cross-slope groups
- Larger Arctic cod: deeper warm slope water and thermisto diet
- Smaller Arctic cod: shallow shelf habitats and smaller calanus prey
