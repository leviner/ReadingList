## Significance:
This paper presents evidence of jellyfish avoidance by Arctic cod in a shallow bay of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.  The authors describe observations of partitioning which they attribute primarily to avoidance.

## Notes:
Pelagic shoals of arctic cod offer opportunistic predators sources to feed quickly in high density prey fields.  

Cyanea capillata (lions mane) are known to prey on larval and juvenile fishes, and it is possible that jellyfish feeding can have large impacts on populations.

Observations are from Resolute Bay (see Geoffrow et al., 2016), with data collected from ice stations and ship surveys using Biosonics (earlier field work) or ES60 (later field work) echosounders.

Jellyfish were identified by their lower TS, but also from cyclical pattern in their TS modulating (as much as -75 to -58), which is attributed to the pulsing of their bell as they swim, as previously studied.  Arctic cod TS varies only a few dB over the course of tracking.

Jellyfish were mostly in warm water near or around the thermocline unless wind mixed throughout the water column, showing a preference for higher salinity water as well.

Arctic cod and jellyfish tended not to share the same depth layer, arctic cod were often associated with the thermo/pycnoline where their prey field (copepods) is most dense.

The separation observed between the two species could be due to nematocysts avoidance  or competition.  Both gelatinous organisms and arctic cod eat copepods in Resolute Bay (though this is not considered to be a primary driver).  Fish shoaled and moved back and forth, if avoidance was not a component of the separation, the fish would have spent more time in the high copepod-density layers regardless of jellyfish presence

Water column conditions may contribute to habitat partitioning  by constraining planktonic drift nearshore and allowing the A. cod to be more mobile with lower encounter rates in the shallow areas.  


Concluding hypotheses
* Nematocyst avoidance is the primary driver of spatial separation between jellyfish and fishes
* If the abundance of stinging jellyfish increases with warming waters, there will be localized/small-scale impacts on arctic cod distribution
