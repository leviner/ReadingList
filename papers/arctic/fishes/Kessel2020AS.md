## Significance:
Acoustic surveys show habitat partitioning by size class of Arctic cod across a shallow bay potentially driven by intraspecific predation, includes TS distributions of larger (>110 mm) fish.

## Notes:
There are many note instances of vertical separation of large and small Arctic cod in the Pacific Arctic, and spatial segregation between schools of different sizes. Large fish appear to prefer deeper depths where predation risk, particularly from avian predators is lower. In shallow embayments, Arctic cod would have less ability to stratify vertically.

Acoustic and direct sampling indicated two shoals of Arctic cod detected on the eastern and western sides of Resolute bay at depths < 15 m. Fish captured on the west side of thre bay were signifiacntly larger (mean length west = 174, east = 110), which was also reflected in TS distributions.

General findings indicate a small-scale horizontal size class segregation in shallow areas and thus they hypothesize intraspecific predation risk may be a key factor in habitat partitioning. In addition, there are ontogenetic differences in diet and different inflows to the bay may result in different prey fields and plankton availability.
