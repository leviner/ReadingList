## Notes:
Building upon the work of Eriksen et al., 2015, they use a coupled ocean circulation and particle tracking model to look for possible spawning sites and egg/larval drift patterns in the Barents sea. The polar cod stock has  experiences large changes in both abundance and distribution between the 1980s and 2000s, which has included a shift in areas occupied by adults and age-0s from the eastern to western Barents.

Possible spawning sites were taken from the literature for areas throughout the Svalbard archipelago. Spawning time has been estimated based on gonad maturity stage and not directly observed. Particles were released on 5 dates, with 5000 particles at each release location. ROMS with an ice component was used for the circulation model with an 800m resolution and 35 vertical bins, with 1-hour steps. Particles were kept at fixed depth.

Incubation time of eggs was based on degree-days, and egg mortality was applied if eggs were unable to reach degree-days within a time period needed to feed. The timing of the plankton bloom was a function of ice cover and salinity, and the days till 50% incubation was used to look at food match-mismatch, and additional mortality was included as a function of salinity/temperature post-hatch. Patterns of age-0 fish from surveys over 2004-2010 were compared with the drift model.

Generally, eggs seeded at the "outer" sites had larger drift patterns than the inner sites. Early released particles which drifted into Atlantic water masses hatched in early february. Later released particles hatched between mid-March and April. Many of these early hatched larvae experienced icy and saline waters and likely did not survive due to decreased light availability and pre mismatch.

Different spawning groups were exposed to very different physical conditions. East/South eggs were covered with ice for most of their development. West sites in Atlantic waters had higher salinity and temperatures.  Northern particles were  mix between the two extremes. Compared with the ship sampling:
- Both model and observations indicated that most eggs that spawned within the fjords or along the coast remained close to the coast
- Age-0 fish in the northwest Barents likely came from Svalbard due to retention of many particles
- When including inner- and outer-spawning groups, the observed abundance near Svalbard matched the simulated distribution.
- Only fish spawned in the north ended up north of Svalbard.

They include habitat-associations by developmental stage for every inner- and outer-spawning region that summarize the suitable spawning habitats around Svalbard based on estimated mortality and growth as a function of the environment.

Early ice breakup in spring was good for early hatchers by allowing sufficient time for fish to grow before the next winter, which results in higher survival rates. The estimated incubation period from the model suggests that 50% hatching occurred from march to late-June, and took between 33 and 95 days.
