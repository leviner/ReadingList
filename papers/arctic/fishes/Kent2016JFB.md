## Significance:
Specifics of process used for multiyear rearing of B. saida in aquarium conditions, including specific measurements of spawning, growth, and key development milestones for fish reared at 3.5C.

## Notes:
Capturing and rearing of Arctic cod is important to be able to study the whole lifecycle of the fish and thus understand climate implications on development.

Successful capture is done in high density aggregations, and trapping shallow 1-2 year olds with dip nets and small seines helps to minimize trauma.  Fish were transported to the aquarium, and acclimated to temperatures of 3.5 and 6.5C when transferred between 0.5C holding temperatures.  They show that B. saida were successful when kept at 3.5C with exposure to 6.5C waters for a month.

With no light or temperature variability, females began to mature and prepare to produce in January - March under no external influence.  However after a few years, this spawning season became less pronounced as they were kept in constant light and temperature conditions.

At 0-1C, it took ~20 days for the eggs to ripen, with egg abundance of ~25k eggs per mature female.  Eggs and larvae were then reared at 3.5C.

AT 3.5C, hatching started 29 days after fertilization, yoc sac was depleted in 7-13 days.  B. saida appear to try to feed within 1 day of hatching.  Feeding the right size food at the right stage seems to be most important for early growth.

Benchmarks of rearing success:
- Fish graduating from live feed cultures to frozen foods
- The second marker is fin formation
- full life cycle is complete when they successfully reproduce

There is additional discussion of appropriate food choices for different growth stages.
