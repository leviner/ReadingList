## Title:
Cod movement ecology in a warming world: Circumpolar arctic gadids
## Keywords:
arctic cod, climate change, literature synthesis, migration
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Review of the movement ecology of Arctic and Polar cod based on the current literature to address (a) movements at multiple scales and (b) the current and potential impacts of climate change. **Excellent source of references, see Figure 5, Tables 3A, 3B**.

## Notes:
Methods
- Literature searches using SCOPUS and WoS, scientific names were used due to synonymous use of common names
- Direct relevance to movement ecology was scored based on used of certain terms in title and text
- Dates, study sites, other gadids/prey/predators identified, and methods were analyzed
- Critical synthesis was then conducted on movement topics from the identified papers and presented by themes within movement ecology

Summary of literature for Arctic cod (B. Saida, A. glacialis is reported but I did not include the same notes)
- 164 articles directly regarding B. saida movement, increasing over time, much of the focus on their relationship with sea ice, vertical movement (size segregation) metabolism and tolerance of temperatures, and climate-driven movements
- Much more of the literature is focused on early life history than adult stages, with the highest number of papers in the Beaufort and Barents Seas
- Long distance horizontal movement of adults was only reported by Kessel 2017, much of the horizontal movements are considered to be assisted by regional currents and are inferred rather than directly observed
  - There is plenty of evidence of long distance vertical migration (onotogenetic) and movement into warmer waster off of the Arctic shelves
  - Genetics and modeling provide ample evidence of long distance transport of early life stage individuals which appear to drift long distances, possibly assisted/in conjunction with ice movement
- Short distance movement is regularly seen in the form of shoaling/schooling in open water, and primary drivers of agreggation are thought to be a combination of geomorphology, temperature, and predatory/prey presence
  - Predatory/prey influence is likely a function of size/age and depth in the water, where fish at deeper locations are less likely to be in a coherent structure where the largest individuals tend to be
  - Those in schools at depth tend to feed less likely minimizing energy expenditure such as due to pre-spawning condition
- Prey-associated movement and response to diet items also vary with body size/age
  - They are pelagic feeders but are also generalists and have a diverse range of feeding habitats, included the benthos
  - Seasonal shifts in availability change vertical movement as migration to follow phyto and zooplankton
  - In summer, reduced biomass at depth likely results in shallow water school formation
- Presence/absence of predators, in particular seabirds and marine mammals (belugas, seals) affect both vertical and horizontal distributions
  - Segregation by size as a result of cannibalism also drives shallower schooling of smaller fishes

Impacts of climate change
- Arctic cod are eurythermal, and initial warming could increase growth rates, increase early hatching success and thus increase time to reach optimum size
- It is hypothesized that increased influx of warm water, increased shipping, and increased competition by summer species will drive both Arctic and Polar cod to higher latitudes for longer periods of the year. This northward retreat has already been reported and well modeled in the Barents
- Both species are known to live in ice and early life stages are surface-associated, and a key change will be the diminishing sea-ice associated productivity and force these fishes to move into the pelagic
- Increasing freshwater could initially increase early larval growth success
- Increasing light penetration due to thinning ice would provide better visual predation, which is energetically better than random seeking, and could also improve their ability to recognize predtors, however, these same advantages could lead to successful competition by sub-boreal species
- It is unclear what the result of increased sub-Arctic species will be, and some findings indicate that the niche partitioning between gadid species will allow Arctic and Polar cod to remain successful, though it is unclear
