## Title:

## Geographic Coverage

## Significance:
Decadal trends in distribution of polar cod and redfish in the Barents Sea, indicating that temperature is a likely important driver of abundance, distribution, and growth in  age-0 polar cod and redfish.

## Notes:
Copepods are the majority of the diet of juvenile polar cod and redfish, which reach maximum biomass in the Barents in mid-summer due to advection of finmarchicus from Atlantic water and glacialis from Arctic waters. Finmarchicus biomass has increased in recent years due to increased advection of Atlantic water. Here, they look at age-0 polar cod and redfish in relationship to temperature from survey time series of 1980-2008.

Pelagic trawls were conducted at 8851 sites in the upper 50 m. Survey results are only compared over identical survey areas. At each trawl station, CTDs were conducted and observations were averaged to standard depths. Fish density was calculates as individuals per square nautical mile.

In the 1980s, polar cod biomass was low, while in the 90s and 00s it was higher and greater in the eastern Barents than west. Redfish densities were highest in the 90s, with high variability in the north. There were distinct modelled peak temperature ranges of 2-5.5 and 5.5-8.5 for polar cod and redfish. Redfish densities increased with increasing temperatures while polar cod peaked around 5.5 degrees. Both fish increased in length with temperature. The lower range of the polar cod temperature dependencies is not quite known due to the variability in sea ice resticting surveys. Ice coverage in both svalbard and the pechora sea is decreasing with time. Because of the increased abundance to the east, a reduction in sea ice and furthered warming could further restrict suitable spawning already restricted to the east. Age-0 redfish may have thermal tolerance beyond what was observed in this study, and are likely more widely distributed in the Norwegian sea.
