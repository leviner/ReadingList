## Significance:
Description of diet variability in age-0 to age-2 arctic cod in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.  Publication of enumerated prey species.

## Notes:
This study describes the summer diets of juvenile (age-0 to 2) arctic cod from the NE Chukchi, looking at spatial variability using lat/lon, and depth as proxies for habitat.

Ontogenetic shifts are common among fishes and impact the size and type of prey they consume

Results:
- pooled across sizes, of all prey consumed, calanoid copepods (specifically calanus spp.) were the dominant prey item.
- Body size was strongly correlated with prey diet composition, with smaller individuals consuming the largest proportions of calanoid copepods and larger individuals having increasingly diverse diets.
- generalist zooplanktivores

Juvenile cod diets are diverse and vary along body size, spatial, and interannual gradients.  As body size increases, their diet becomes more complex and they become more proficient at eating larger more profitable prey.  Any between-sea diets didn't occur until fish became >50mm in size.

Interannual variability was only quantified in the Chukchi where it could be due to gear selectivity or meroplankton/euphausiid production.  There was also extended sampling relative to other years.
