## Title:

## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Comparison of the distribution of B. saida and capelin based on observations of both stocks since the 1970s.  Gives overview of both species life cycle and impacts of heating and reduced sea ice on populations individually and potential interactions.

## Notes:
In the Barents, B. saida are associated with cold <0C water and moderate salinities.  The spatial distribution appears to be consistent between years, limited by the cold fresh water of the polar front to the south.  Fish in the warmer waters (3-4C) west of spitsbergen appear to grow faster than those in the colder canadian arctic, and the presence in temepratures below its thermal maximum is likely due to the combination of its antifreeze proteins and the reduced habitat competition.

Retreat of sea ice is important to the feeding of both fish stocks.  Ice melt stabilizes the upper water column and allowing light penetration, which lead to algal blooms.  Ice algae begin about two months prior to the open water blooms, and are important for C. glacialis following diapause.  B. saida use the ice habitat for feeding.  Drifitng sea ice is a habitat for juveniles, and they become pelagic as ice melts.  Egg development may take place under sea ice but end in open water.  Larvae are commonly found under ice near river plumes .  The ice edge in the Barents changes annually based on the polar front.  

Polar cod spawns in winter beneath the sea ice , while capelin spawns on the bottom.  Cod are a winter spawner, while capelin spawn late-winter to spring.  Polar cod eggs are larger than capelin, and have a longer development time (45-60 days relative to 15-50 days).  Both larvae feed on nauplii and juvenile copepods, and in the Barents and Kara, B. saida timing appears to be tied to pseudocalanus copepods.  Larger capelin consume a higher proprtion of krill than b. saida.

Impacts of potential reduced sea ice: Earlier ice retreat could lead to greater survival success of early hatchers, or reduce the abundance of suitable zooplankton prey as ice algae disappears.  Loss of sea lice may also increase predation, and the deep aggregations will become more vulnerable to deep diving species without ice limiting air.  There is expected increased competition among pelagic stocks, and off spitsbergen, some of the deep water fjords may eventually become too warm for b. saida.  Capelin are currently limited in distribution without an antifreeze protein, and need to move out of winter water masses.  Capelin could become year round residents under additional heating.  The pelagc foodweb will likely increase production in the Barents, attracting more upper trophic level predators (seabirds and mammals).  However, there is evidence that changes in feeding from b. saida to capelin in certain years leads to reduced growth rates in some seabirds.  Smaller zooplankton with lower energy content could favor capelin over B. saida.
