## Significance:
Study of body and lipid condition under different temperature-food conditions, showing temperature directly impacts larval A cod and pollock, and condition varies with both temperature and food availability.

## Notes:
Rules for better figures:
1. Be aware of your audience and the expected message you want them to retain. In some cases (public) it is best to approximate your message rather than provide as inclusive a figure as possible.
2. Develop your message before producing a figure.
3. Be aware of the medium the figure will be used in, with particular regard to the length of time the figure will be available to view for the audience (printed vs. presentation)
4. Captions are necessary to inform the reader how to interpret the figure.
5. Default plotting libraries should not be assumed to be accurate to your message.
6. Consider which colors to use and where. Is there any reason this isn't in black and white? Use a colormap style (sequential, divergin, qualitative) that reflects your message.
7. While a scientific figure is meant to directly describe data (true values), if you do not strictly follow that structure then you may lead to misinterpretation (i.e., is scaling, labels accurate?). Inappropriate use of chart types can be more misleading than intended.
8. Limit "junk", i.e., unnecessary layers on top/below the data that only serve to confuse the reader.
9. Message is more important than looks.
10. Understanding the proper tool for the job is important.
