## Title:
The Changing Nature of Shelf-Break Exchange Revealed by the OOI Pioneer Array
## Keywords:
shelf break, climate change, warming, gulf stream
## Geographic Coverage
New England Shelf Break
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:


## Notes:
Circulation along the shelf break is primarily westward bounded by the front and jet. The front is the boundary between cold-fresh and warm-salty slope water. This front is unstable and can meander significantly. Long-term variations are needed to estimate the heat and salt flux of this cross-shelf exchange. Of interest is the impact on fish habitat of episodic and seasonal warming related to exchange, and the effect of cumulative warming on storm intensity and severity. Increased exchange can also lead to warming on the shelf, changing the density gradients and feeding back into the exchange process. Gulf stream meandering also impacts these exchanges, with increasing number of warm core rings.

Here, they use the glider system of the pioneer array to characterize the shelf break front structure. The shelf break front is a transition from the cooler fresher shelf waters to the salty warm slope water.

Water masses
- The slope waters are driven by two sources: subpolar from the north and subtropical from the south.
- The glider data indicates that the subtropical waters were dominant over recent years.
  -  This has major biological implications and is inline with the shift in the destabilization point of the gulf stream and the increase in warm core rings

Ring interactions
- The onshore intrusion of a ring in 2014 had not been previously reported
- Glider data from the array showed complete water column replacement by the warm core ring rather than being entrapped at the surface by the shelfbreak jet.
- The alongshore extension of the ring due to momentum is a new exchange process which is associated with significant on shelf transport
- There are major biochemical implications due to the transport of water an organisms
- During the ring passing, there was a tongue of shelf water that passed over the upstream offshore mooring
  - This first reaches the mooring at shallow depth, and appears to increase in depth as it passes
  - This is likely NOT due to increasing depth of the water parcels which would require significant energy to mix
  - Because the temp/sal/oxy remains consistent (not mixed), it reflects the tilted angle of the water mass as it passes due to the sheared flow of the front and rings

  Combining fishermen data with OOI
  - Slight shift in species composition in winter months observed on the shelf during a warm core ring intrusion

Uses/Implications of using OOI
- measure significant shelf break exchange events since it started, and some of these anomalies have rarely been observed previously , such as on shelf intrusions
- The next step would be to use velocity to calculate buoyancy fluxes
- These observations suggest there are rapid changes happening at the shelf break,
