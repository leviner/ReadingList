N/A
## Significance:
Use of annual CTD surveys of the New England Shelf break to investigate changes from 2003 to 2012 in shelf structure, finding warming and increasing buoyancy likely related to observed changes in the gulf stream meanders.

## Notes:
The New England shelf break is one of the more rapidly warming regions of the ocean, with major consequences for the fishing and shellfish industry. However there are few repeat observations in space over long time periods to establish subsurface trends. Long time series are available for temperature but not temp/salinity or other system dynamics. Other time series programs don't sample the full extent of the shelf break.

The shelf break front which forms due to the shelf break jet, and impacts the strength of the upwelling along the front driven by the bottom boundary layer convergence. There haven't been any studies looking at long-term trends in changes to this front structure.  

Here they use 11 years of surveys from the Sea Education Association annual survey with WHOI to Atlantis canyon collecting samples along the shelf break.

Methods
- 10 Day cruises from 2003 to 2013
- Sampling occurs in a U shape resulting in two cross shelf surveys
- Used SBE SEACAT for all collections
- data was interpolated to 5m by 5km resolution

Results
- Surface waters are strong with a strong thermocline, increasing offshore under the influence of the gulf stream, also increasing in salinity
- On the shelf, remnant winter water is present at depth, offshore, the permanent thermocline is present
- Interannual variability was highest near surface on the shelf, likely due to the frontal meanders
- There is evidence of a frontal meander shown as the appearance of cold shelf water in the upper water column detached and off shelf
- In 2012, the minimum temp of the cold pool is much warmer, but
- There was a significant trend in temperature and strong density change on the shelf, with no significant change in salinity, thus the increase in stratification is due to temperature-driven buoyancy

Temperature was the only significant trend, agreeing well with previous work further south near New Jersey (Forsyth et al., 2015), thought both studies find large interannual variability and need to continue their observations. The upper slope is also much more salty than previous decades, even if not a significant trend within these observations, and also indicates that large-amplitude meanders of the gulf stream are shifting further west, reaching the new England shelf break.
