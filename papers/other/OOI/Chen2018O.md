## Notes:
The shelf-break front and jet separate the warm sub-tropic (Gulf Stream) and cool sub-polar (Labrador Current) waters along the New England Shelf Break. There is long-term evidence of warming in the Northwest Atlantic, with associated shifts across the ecosystem, and better understanding of the heat balance and temperature anomalies is important. The primary drivers of heat exchange in this region are air-sea exchange, along-shelf advective flux, and cross-shelf advective flux.

Heat balance
- Surface air-sea flux and along-shelf advective flux are the primary drivers, though their influence depends on timescale, and there are uncertainties on the balance between those two.
- Cross-shelf exchange processes are important particularly for shorter time scales (days to weeks) due to eddy flux from gulf stream and shelf break jet instabilities. This process continue to change as we see an increase in the occurrence of warm core rings and changes in the meander of both the Gulf and front jets.
- Though the exact causes of long-term warming trends are not clear, long-term studies point to both atmospheric and oceanic processes.
  - Pershing found trends between SST and decadal+ scale indices such as the AMO and PDO.
  - Forsyth found potential forcing of the shelfbreak front further onshore, increasing the presence of warm slope water on the shelf.
- Extreme events are typically atmospheric forcings, such as the extreme heating in 2012 due to jet stream movement.
