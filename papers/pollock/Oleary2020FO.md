## Notes:
Over the warming of the past 40 years, the northern Bering Sea has changed, and for fisheries management to respond they have to be able to identify which fishes are most impacted, and quantitatively identify changes in distribution in response to climate change.

Pollock are known to respond to changes in temperature, particularly in response to the change in extent of the Bering Sea cold pool. During low cold pool extent, fish move north, corresponding with previous work linking a southward shift in the dirtibution of pollock with expansion in the cold pool. 

Here, they use spatiotemporal modeling (VAST) to look at distribution, accounting for ship and habitat effects.

There are two pollock fishing seasons in the EBS: winter (Jan-April) and summer (Jun - Oct). In this summer season, the fishery tends to fish further north and towards the border. They generated a biomass index with and without cold pool effects, as well as generating age compositions.

To look at range shift, they calculated center of mass and effective occupied area based on the biomass estimates.

From 2010 to 2019, pollock biomass increase din the NBS by 78%. During this period there was a 48% increase in the EBS. Model predicitons were improved when including the cold pool index. 

The proportion of pollock in the EBS (relative to the NBS) has been steadily trending downwards, with a particular shift occurring between 2014 and 2019 corresponding to a dramatic decrease in cold pool extent. A key driving factor is also the size of the age 2012 year class.

From 1982 to 2019, the center  of distribution of pollock in summer has moved ~150 km north. This is accompanied by an increase in the overall effective occupied area. Since 2010, the effective area has increased throughout the region by 170%. The CPI had a strong net negative affect on northern extent in 2012 and net positive affect in 2018 and 2019 (warm years). 

*The greatest variability in biomass int he NBS occurrs in the final 6 years.

Vast predicted age compositions are consistent with the observed age-length key, with the occurrence of key cohorts. Where they differed for fish older than age-1, the model-based estimate was higher. The NBS has the most variable age of fish.

The VAST predicted stock assessment was 8-13% higher from 2012 to 2019, due to higher recruitment between 2009 and 2014. The differences between the models would results in a reduction in ABC by 3%.
