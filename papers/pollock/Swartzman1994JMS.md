## Title:
Relating the distribution of pollock schools in the Bering Sea to environmental factors 
## Keywords:
pollock, pelagic, behavior, spatial distribution
## Geographic Coverage
Eastern Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
06/01/1991 - 09/01/1991
## Significance:
Investigation of summer pollock school distribution relative to environmental conditions.

## Notes:
Using acoustic images from an EK500 survey of the EBS, they use image-resolving methods to break down the observations into schooling parameters to match with the environmental conditions. Based on trawling, schools were assumed to be pollock. 

Identified 46000 schools based on a minimum size of 6x16 m. Temperature data were intepolated along the transect using linear interpolation based on CTD/XBT data.

School 'mass' (density) was estimaed based on backscatter energy.

Produced GAM using:
- school depth
- temperature
- school area
- school mass (backscatter)
- number of schools
- bottom depth
- thermocline depth

In deeper water, schools were also deeper. Larger (denser) schools were in area with fewer schools (lots of small schools or few big schools).

Key findings:
- The separatioin of age-0 and adult pollock via the thermocline with larger pollock below and smaller pollock above
- Bottom depth played a major influence on school distribution, with higher schooling densities and larger schools when shallow
- As you move towards the outer shelf slope, fish begin to remain above the thermocline
- Fish remain in deeper warm water layers below the melt water in regions associated with ice melt.

They found no evidence for summer DVM in large (adult) pollock, but consistent DVM behavior of age-0s
