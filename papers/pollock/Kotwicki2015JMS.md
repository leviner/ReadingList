## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Evaluation and comparison of pollock availability to bottom trawl and acoustic water column data as a function of environment and size.

## Notes:
Bottom trawl catches are restricted to the effective fishing height of the net, while acoustic data are limited by the acoustic deadzone, thus the relationship between these two methods of observation is tricky. However, catchability (q) is spatially and temporally variable across surveys, so achieving reliable comparision between multiple survey methodologies may be meaningless. For bottom trawls, you need to know whats above them, and for acoustics, you need to know whats in the ADZ. Thus, by using both at the same time you can establis the relationship between the two. However this is not as simple as qBT = 1-qA, as a large portion of the water column is sampled by both gear types.

They used trawls where pollock were >75% of the catch by abundance, and then used empiracal relationships to convert the pollock in the depths of the effectice fishing height of the bottom trawl to sA for comparision to the acoustics.

Most of the pollock were available to the bottom trawl at all times (q >.9) with much less (q=.3) available to the acoustics. The availability of pollock tot he BT was lowest in the darkest conditions, increasing with increasing light levels. Fork length was also a key predictor, with limited impact of pollock density. Predicted acoustic availability was much lower, with surface temperature and fork length being singificant predictors.

Near bottom light levels and bottom depth are the most important variables. Fork length as a factor indicated that smaller fish tended to be located within the effective height for acoustic observations while larger fish availability was higher for the bottom trawl. Sediment size indicated that pollock may be likely to be lower to the seabed in sandy/muddy environments than in rocky conditions.
