## Title:
Variation in the distribution of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) with temperature and implications for seasonal migration
## Keywords:
pollock, migration, temperature
## Geographic Coverage
Eastern Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Evaluating the relationship between temperature and distribution of pollock in the EBS. Most fish, especially smaller (<30 cm) move northwards with increasing temperature. They discuss the possible reasons behind migration and the implications regarding movement into the Russian EEZ.

## Notes:
Pollock are known to migrate seasonally throughout the north pacific. Generally, these are described as spring/summer migrations from spawning grounds to feeding areas. While it's assumed to occur in the EBS, data on the magnitudes, routes, and size-dependence is limited.

Temperature is believed to be important to migration; pollock exhibit a preference for environmental conditions linked with food availability and avoid cold temperatures. The relationship between water temperature and the distribution of migrating species can be used to infer changes in the timing of migration.

Using bottom trawl and acoustic surveys, they investigate how the variability in distribution in relation to temperature in the EBS may be explained by feeding migrations. Temperature is used to establish the timing of the surveys relative to the possible migration period. Because of length-dependent behaviours, patterns were investigated for 5 groups, and density data was scaled to each length class in each year. The slope of density vs temperature across years was calculated to determine if areas were exhibiting increasing/decreasing density with increasing/decreasing temperatures. E.g., a positive slope (>0.3) indicated that biomass increases with increases in temperature. 

These slopes by station were interpolated spatially in order to create spatial regions. Spatially correlated clusters were determined, and the mean temperature and percent of total biomass in each survey was calculated to investigate the importance of each cluster. This was summarized by looking at the relationship between the mean temmperature vs the % of fish within the cluster. Clusters with the strongest relationships were chosen for additional investigation.

All categories (length classes) exhibited northward and inshore shifts. For smaller fish (<30cm) in the AT survey, large reductions with temperature along rthe shelf break were offset by increases to the northwest. Overall, northward temperature reflected a shift in 50-80% of biomass into a northern area. Fish >50 cm is tough to evaluate from the acoustics since much of these fish are benthic and not effectively sampled in the AT surveys.

In the bottom trawl data, the same trends, especially for small fishes were observed, with a slightly more inshore/eastward redistribution.

Overall, nterannual differences in timing and migration are related to water temperature. Cold temperatures may delay the onset of spawning and delay post-spawning migrations. The warmer the summer is, the farther the 50> cm fish seem to be found from their spawning grounds. Warmer years should be more representative of what is typically seen later in the season.

They did not detect major differences near the major spawning areas, which they infer that the fish had already moved out of the area (spawning had progressed already) by the time of the survey. Generally, the smaller fish are consistently distributed farther north. *Pola (1985) identified two migrations, a temperature driven migration to the northwest and a seasonal migration to the northeast into shallower water.

Smaller pollock (<30 cm) appear to migrate less distance than larger fishes. Larger fish migratory behavior is difference, likely linked to the transition in prey type and feeding behavior.

Reasons for migration: pollock tend to migrate with rising temperatures. They are assumed to avoid temperatures below 0, so increasing temperatures beyond 0 open up new areas for migration. Seasonal patterns in zooplankton and prey availability coincide with migration, and fish may be following their prey northwards, particularly small fishes which are primarily feeding on pelagic zooplankton.

Currents in the area are 1-5 cm s-1 and north/northwest. Pollock may follow the visual cue of the transport of their prey. Further, longer days with greater light availability increase their foraging.

While it's hard to assess which of these is most important, they conclude that regardless, pollock benefit from this northward migraiton. As expected, this same migration pattern is also seen in other fish populations in the northern hemisphere, such as pelagic and semi-pelagic species in the western North Pacific and the Barents Sea.

More pollock may be leaving the survey area with increasing temperatures, thus further data is needed to evaluate the movement of fishes in the russian zone and the northern Bering Sea. Further changes in climate may change the migration timing and period, alter the amount of fish moving into the Russian EEZ, thus changing the biomass available to the fishery.
