## Title:
Changes in the vertical distribution of age-0 walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) during warm and cold years in the southeastern Bering Sea
## Keywords:
recruitment, acoustic, depth distribution
## Geographic Coverage
Southeastern Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Vertical distribution of age-0 pollock changes with climatoligical stanzas, with evidence that fish are shallower during warmer periods in the southeastern Bering Sea.

## Notes:
Over the past 20 years, oceanographic conditions of the Bering Sea have shifted between 1-2 year events and 4-6 year stanzas, and pollock recruitment is believed to be tied to these shifts. 

Spatial/Timing match-mismatch with their prey can impact whether the effects of these changing oceanographic conditions help or hurt recruitment.

Data from BASIS surveys in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016. Acoustic data were collected for fish, zooplankton were sampled using a bongo net at a series of stations in a standardized grid. Midwater sampling was done with a Cantrawl, NETS-156, and a mod(1)-marinovich.

Age-0 pollock abundance was estimated based on standard acoustic-trawl proportional allocation. Note from me: this is assuming a lot about the selectivity of these nets...

Weighted mean depth for the age-0 length classes were calculated to get vertical distribution based on the acoustics. Body condition was estimated using bomb calorimetry.
