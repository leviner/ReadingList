Short review of trends in pollock stock and history of fishery in the north Pacific.

## Notes:
Large scale pollock fishery dates back to the 1960s in the eastern Bering Sea. Highest period of catch was in the 1980s (~7 million tons). In the 2000's this has decreased to maximum take of ~2.8 million tons, still remaining the second most fished single species fisheries in the world (behind anchovy).

In the early fishery, Japan dominated the landings, which was quickly overtaken by Russia. Since the 2000s, US and Russia have been close, 1.5-2 million tons.

FOllowing WWII, Japanese and Russian fisheries developed for pollock. Initially, Russian fleets in the EBS found low densities of pollock, with catches dominated by flounder and other species. Russian research in the 60's shows a substantial increase in the pollock stock, and stabilized in the 70s.

Four primary areas are the EBS (1.1mt), WBS(400kt), Navarin area (300kt), and the donut hole(200kt), which was only fished from 1984-1991.

Maximum catch in the Bering Sea reached 4mt in 1988, following a period where biomass was believed to have reached 30mt. The massive decrease following this period is believed to be associated with the unregulated fishing in international waters.

In 1993, a convention on the management of stock assessment was ratified and the catch-biomass correlations since are well correlated.

The second largest fishery area is the Sea of Okhotsk. Similarly, the fishery began in the 1960s with the first small (35kt) landings, and continued to increase, reaching a peak of 1.3mt in 1975. The landings decreased in the early 80s before reaching a second peak (1.5mt) in 1988 after extension of the fishery into the northern region of the sea. The fishery has since eveled off at landings <1mt.

While not significant today, the Sea of Japan played a major role in the total landings in the early 1980s, when catches exceeded 2mt. However, since the 1990s, this fishery has decreased to 200kt and below, with little importance to the overall fishery today.

Reasons for the dynamics

Recruitment abundance: The conditions that occur during initial spawning of fish may be important. in the GoA, abundance is believed to be dependent on atmospheric conditons such as rainfall, sea level pressure, and wind, due to the bouyancy of the eggs and their surface development. In the Bering Sea, this can be impacted by sea ice. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the PDO is believed to play a role in regulating recruitment success, as in Japan, the Oyashio current, which strongly drives major fluctuations in temperature, is believed to be the driver.

Ricker's curve: there is no correlatio between female abundance and recruitment in the EBS.

Temperature: believed that cold years yield 'weak' generations and warm years result in high abundance. However, while warm years may lead to early survival, warm temperatures in autumn lead to poor overwinter survival. All of this is a balance between increased hatch success, growth rate, food availability, and metabolism. There is a positive correlation between temperature the year prior to spawning and abundance of age-5 fish.

Given the role of temperature, global climatic trends have been investigated, such as the northern pacific index and PDO. In the EBS, the duration of the spring bloom is positively correlated to NPI, leading to increased abundances is copepods (improved prey availability). In the Sea of Okhostk, pollock biomass is correlated with the PDO, yet this hasn't been observed in other regions.
