## Title:
Distribution of fish and macrozooplankton in ice-covered and open-water
areas of the eastern Bering Sea
## Keywords:
pollock, winter, distribution, migration 
## Geographic Coverage
Eastern Bering Sea
## Field Dates:
04/10/2007 - 07/31/2008
## Significance:
Winter and spring acoustic observations indicate seasonal migration of pollock away from the ice edge, while zooplankton distribution remains less influenced by seasonal temperature changes.

## Notes:
The presence of the cold pool impacts fish distributions in summer. Generally, water temperatures and ice cover have the greatest influence on the distribution of fish and zooplankton in spring when these conditions are at their greatest.

Using an icebreaker, they collected acoustic data on the distribution of fish in two years during periods of ice cover (March to May) in comparison wtih ice-free summer surveys. The goals were to document the spring distributions, compare them to summer distributions, and relate those differences to temperature and ice conditions.

Outfitted the USCGC Healy with an EK60 (38 and 120), and used comparable measurements from two NOAA vessels. The major issue was ringing from the Healy hull, thus only data > 30m was analyzed. A dual-frequency classification approach was used to identify fish and zooplankton scattering, and 38 kHz sA was calculated. 

57 and 58 20-nmi grid cells were surveyed in both seasons in 2007 and 2008, respectively. These grid cells were used to calculate center of gravity. The relationship between the environemntal conditions and abundances were identified using GAMs.

In spring (ice-covered period), fish backscatter was primarily observed at > 100 m depth. The longitudinal distribution was generally similar in spring and summer, but with fish extending further north onto the shelf in summer. Zooplankton backscatter was more evenly distributed.

Fish were most abundant within a narrow range of environmental conditions (bottom tempereatures between 1 and 2 C in spring and 1-3 in summer; Ice cover < 25% in winter). In the GAM, distance to ice edge, bottom temp, and ice cover were all significant.

The northern boundary of the distribution of pollock is largely determined by temperature and ice cover, and their distribution is mediated by temperature year-round. The observation of fiew fish of anykind on the shelf indicates that in spring, the overlap between age-1 and age-2+ pollock is likely the highest, and therefore cannibalism may increase in cold years when they're habitat is most restricted. Ice may also mediate predator-prey relationship due to the impact on light and limitations on visual predation.

"Shifts in pelagic fish distribution from spring to summer are principally to the north-west along the outer shelf, with the largest shift in the northern areas."
