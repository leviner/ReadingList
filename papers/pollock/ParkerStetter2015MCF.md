## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Significance:
Investigation of role vs. ontogeny in vertical distribution of age-0 pollock. Water column properties did not have a strong effect on vertical distribution.

## Notes:
Seasonally, age-0 pollock are associated with different parts of the water column. In the spring, they're found near the thermocline and higher up in the water column. By the following summer, they have transitioned to a more demersal life. In the late-summer early fall period of their first year, pollock have been observed throughout the water column, and this variability in vertical distribution can alter the design and accuracy of surveys.

There could be both biological and physical explanations of this variability in distribution: thermal preferences, light, maximizing potential growth vs length, food, and prey size. Fish could also be making this pelagic-demersal transition at the time of the surveys.

Work was done on the BASIS surveys in the EBS, followed by additional surveys into fall. CTDs were used for temperature conditions and a cantrawl was used for both midwater and surface (with float) sampling. Acoustic data was processed by identifying agreggations using a minimum Sv threshold. Length, thickness, and mean Sv were computed for each agreggation and were assigned a CTD.

Because of patchiness of age-0 pollock, probability of occurrence was modeled and used for the analysis. The variables (within 1-m bis) chosen for explanation of the vertical distribution were: depth, vertical density gradient, water temperature, relative rater temperature, DO, salinity, and zooplankton density. Models were evaluated using AIC.
 
Given the selectivity of the cnatrawl was unknown, catches were categorized by magnitude rather than exact catches, and used to compare midwater and surface trawls.

Stations were reoccupied over the course of the different surveys included and aggregation attributes were evaluated between each sample. Fork length and energy density were compared between surface and midwater trawls collected at the same station, as well as over time.

Water column and zooplankton properties has significant but weak effects on age-0 vertical distributions. The most significant single variable associations were DO (occurrence) and salinity (density). The multi-variable models also explained little of the variance (low R2).

Agreggations were larger (thickness and length) at deeper sites. The center of mass moved deeper with deepening bottom.

The strongest variable was autocorrelation: schooling was more prevalent when there were more fish.
