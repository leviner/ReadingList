## Significance:
Spatiotemporal modeling of cod, pollock, and plaice biomass in the eastern, northern, and western bering sea regions. All species show northward shifts, with the cold pool playing a key part. The availability to the EBS and locations of hotspots indicates significant movement across the western and eastern sectors.

## Notes:
As a consequence of climate change, species and ecosystems are shifting, spatially. In the PAR, this is resulting in a poleward shift of species distributions. Reductions in sea ice have led to changes in water column properties, including cold pool extent and stratification, typicaly thermal boundaries for northward movement in groundfish. Pollock, cod, and plaice are shifting north, with implications for commercial and subsistence fishing.

A key difficulty from the management perspective is tracking the movement of these fish into areas that historically have not been surveyed, or across management boundaries. There is a need to share data across political borders, improving data sharing and colaboration for highly mobile species.

Here, they use spatiotemporal modeling to combine the different bottom trawl efforts in the U.S. and Russian sectors of the northern Bering Sea for pollock, cod, and plaice. This includes various environmental conditions to estimate the environmental drivers of their habitat.

Key questions:
- How does the environment affect biomass and interannual variability?
- What are the spatial patterns in distribution?
- How does the center of gravity and occupied area shift over time?
- What as the availability of fish to the AFSC survey region

The Bering shelf was divided into three subregions, the EBS, WBS (west of the maritime border), and NBS (north of St. Matthew). Data comes from AFSC and TINRO. Data from all surveys included presence/absence, and where present, total biomass.

Biomass was estimated using VAST with and without cold pool effects (CPI) for the shelf. A catchability covariate was incuded to account for the differences in the survey sources. Random variation between surveys accounted for differences in gear, vessel, and operation. AIC (marginal) was used to assess the difference between models that did and didn't include cold pool effects. center of gravity and area occupied were calculated by region and as a whole.

Oceanographic variability
- The modell that included the spatial covariate effects of the cold pool had the greatest explanation for all 3 secies. (note, all <12%). Estimated aptial effect of the cold pool was strongest for pollock and cod (right in the middle of the shelf has the highest likelihood of decrease with high cold pool index). 

Patterns
- Hot spots typically span the border in the WBS, especially in warm years. Pollock and cod expanded across this region in particular since 2016, with all three species expanding northwards.

CoG
- All three species are shifting northwards at different rates, with cod moving the furthest north. This trend appears to have begun ~2000. The eastings for pollock and cod vary, while plaice are consistently centered west of the convention line. Effective areas appear to be steadily increasing for pollock and plaice.

Availability
- The estimated proportion of biomass available to the EBS survey doesn't change whether CPI is included or not. The proportion in the EBS relative to the WBS and NBS is highly variable. The availability of pollock in the EBS was less than 0.5 for only 2018, when the majority were in the combined WBS+NBS. Note that the last year of available observations in the WBS was 2017.  Cod was similar, with the availability trending upwards in the WBS and NBS from 2014-2017. Plaice availability has been steadily increasing in the WBS+NBS since ~2000.+

Discussion/Conclusions
- "Hotspots" span the maritime border, particularly during warm years, and a big shift northward over 2015-2019. 
- "The consistent spatial distribution of groundfish density across the southern Bering Sea shelf after correcting for differences in fishing power in the two surveys suggests connectivity between groundfish species in the EBS and WBS, particularly pollock and cod. "
- All three species appear to extend into the NBS, and pollock and cod tend to extend into the region occupied by the cold pool. This is consistent with the Eisner work that EBS and EBS pollock are mingling in the NBS.
- "We advocate expanded efforts to corroborate estimates in areas without consistent sampling data; for example, using upward-facing acoustics as auxiliary information to track movement across the Conventional Line"
- The proportion found in the EBS and WBS was highly variable and there is likely a lot of mixing, especially for periods where EBS availability was low (2017- 2019). Combined with the reduction in sea ice and CPI, there is potentially increased movement of pollock across the border.
- This study is mising age structure.
