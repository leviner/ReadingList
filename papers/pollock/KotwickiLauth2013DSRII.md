## Significance:
Analysis of 30 years of bottom trawl surveys to look at global and local similarities/changes in response to changes in the cold pool.

## Notes:
The distribution of bottom fishes and crabs in the EBS is affected by change sin the extent of the cold pool. Given the high variability between wwarm and cold periods, one would expect both local and population level shifts in distribution, particularly for migratory species with limited thermal tolerance.

This paper uses a 30 year time series of bottom trawl data, with a focus on the role of temperature, but additionally considers variability due to inter-year changes in abundance and temporal lag. Thus, two indices were considered, one based on the year-to-year shelf-wide response (GIC), and a second looking at the location-by-location change in abundance (LIC). A GAM was used to model the responses.

CPUE from bottom trawl survey data from 1982-2011 were used, with the mean value extrapolated to each stratum area and summed to determine total abundances. Bottom temperatures were recorded via an XBT or headrope thermometer at each trawl location.

Taxa for analysis were selected based on their consistent presence throughout the time seies. Spatial indicies: global index of collocation - whether a population center of abundance has shifted based on pairwise comparison of CG, and local index - uses location-by-location pairwise comparison. Both have ranges 0-1, where 1 indicates complete similarity. A GAM was then used to see how GIC and LIC responded to temperature and cold pool extent, difference in population abundance, and time lag.

The LIC (0.32-0.78)were more variable than the GIC (0.83-0.98) for all taxa.

Pollock (I'm only going to focus on this): distribution decreased in similarity with an increase in the cold pool are and change in year. Cold year center of gravity was west of warm years (shift along a southeast/northwest axis). This is due to a shift toward the shelf edge in cold years. Local similarities (LIC) were not affected by the cold pool, but decreased in similarity with increasing abundance. When abundance was high, pollock spread further in the middle and inner shelf.  The northwest shift was a recent occurrence.

"Nevertheless, the short-term interannual variability in spatial patterns do appear to respond to fluctuations in the area occupied by the cold pool,
suggesting that populations will indeed respond similarly to decreasing cold pool extent over the long-term by shifting northward"

One additional possibility for the northward shift is the high fishing pressure in the southeast shelf.
