Life history of pollock in the Bering Sea

## Notes:
There are two large stocks of pollock in the Bering, the western and the eastern stock. EBS stock reproduction occurrs across a large portion of the shelf, and western in Olutorskiy and Karaginskiy Bays. A large portion of the EBS stock is traced back to the SE Bering Sea. There are two distrinct groups: 'shelf' and 'basin' spawners, which agreggate at different depths. These two distinct spawning areas are relatively stable, though the shelf vs basin may be distinct stocks in the EBS.

5+ year old mature pollock migrate fromt he outer shelf to the slope by late-winter, early-spring, especially around the canyons. These are the 'Basin spawners'.

Winter distributions: Larger concentrations between Zemchug and Priblof canyons, where 3-8 year old fish were. Immature yonger pollock were distributed further north along the outer shelf.

There doesn't appear to be any connection between the strength of a year class and it's distribution. Winter survival varied significantly over time, with a relationship between the abundance of YOY in fall and the strength of the 1 year old year class the following summer. Thus the high interannual variability in the stock is due to winter survival.

The anual variation in the spatial distribution, particularly in the EBS, is a function of zoop abundance, temperature, total biomass, and age composition.
