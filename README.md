# ReadingList

I am attempting to keep track of reading journal articles by maintaining a git repository that contains notes and .bib files specific to certain projects/themes/manuscripts.

The goal is that these .md files will be able to be indexed by python based on things like author, keywords, and dates.  An example file, `noteTemplate.md` is available in the current directory.  Indexing can be done with `readingStats.py` which will be updated as needed.

# Paper Folders
![readingTimeline](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/blob/master/readingCloud.png)![readingTimeline](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/blob/master/readingTimeline.png)

Notes (author, year, journal in file header) on readings.  Top of each note document has authors, year, journal, title, and keywords as subsections that can be used to later index through files if needed. Each folder contains a `.bib` file updated with each new `.md` note file for use in compiling references in LaTeX.  Upon reading each paper, a new note file is made, an addition is entered into the `.bib` file, and `readingStats.py` is executed to repopulate the below list and update the figures above.

     * Vestfals et al aim to narrow down the potential spawning grounds for arctic and saffron cod based on the physical oceanography and summer distribution.  It contains a good review in the intro of the current literature on early life history.

     * This study aimed to describe the trophic structure and function of the Chukchi Sea foodweb using an ecopath model, representing just one of many possible mass-balance solutions.  Fish estimates were taken from beam trawl samples of the Eastern Chukchi shelf. 
* [Wyllie-Echeverria1997AFS - Water masses and transport of age-0 Arctic cod and age-0 Bering flounder into the northeastern Chukchi Sea](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/papers/pacificArctic/fishes/Wyllie-Echeverria1997AFS.md) 
     * Describe the abundance and distribution of larval bering flounder in late summer from 1989-1991 in relation to the sampled water masses.  Included collection of age-0 Arctic cod throughout the NE Chukchi to investigate water mass associations.

     * Discussion of the causes and impacts of climate change in the Arctic.

     * Analysis of changes in melt and freeze timing of the artcic and implications for heat storage and SST due to albedo effects.  Contains a table of melt and freeze onset by region. 

### zooplankton

     * Description of the late-summer zooplankton community composition at Hannah Shoal during August of 2012 and 2013, focusing on copepods and euphausiids of interest for bowhead whales. 
* [Day2013CSR - The offshore northeastern Chukchi Sea, Alaska: A complex high-latitude ecosystem](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/papers/pacificArctic/zooplankton/Day2013CSR.md) 
     * Synthesis of the findings from the Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program from 2008-2010 at three regions of oil exploration interest near Hanna Shoal. 
* [Ershova2015PB - Inter-annual variability of summer mesozooplankton communities of the western Chukchi Sea: 2004â€“2012](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/papers/pacificArctic/zooplankton/Ershova2015PB.md) 
     * Description of the zooplankton community in relation to water masses during 4 years of the RUSALCA survey program.  Community structure strongly correlated with bottom temperature. 
* [Kitamura2017CSR - Seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in the southern Chukchi Sea revealed from acoustic backscattering strength](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/papers/pacificArctic/zooplankton/Kitamura2017CSR.md) 
     * Use of AZFPs to describe the seasonality of zooplankton biomass, and identify the dominant scatterers in the southern Chukchi Sea, finding a seasonal peak in biomass in autumn and a minimum in early spring, not corresponnding with phytoplankton production.  Zooplpankton communities in the southern Chukchi are largely driven by advection from the Bering. 
* [PinchukEisner2017DSRII - Spatial heterogeneity in zooplankton summer distribution in the eastern Chukchi Sea in 2012â€“2013 as a result of large-scale interactions of water masses](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/papers/pacificArctic/zooplankton/PinchukEisner2017DSRII.md) 
     * Describe the differences in zooplankton distribution (focussed on Calanus species of copepods) between 2012 and 2013 as part of the Arctic EIS study.  Zooplankton distribution is wind-driven and a balance between melt water and northward advection of warm Pacific water.
