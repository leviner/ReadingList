# ReadingList

I am attempting to keep track of reading journal articles by maintaining a git repository that contains notes and .bib files specific to certain projects/themes/manuscripts.

The goal is that these .md files will be able to be indexed by python based on things like author, keywords, and dates.  An example file, *noteTemplate.md* is available in the current directory.  Indexing can be done with `readingStats.py` which will be updated as needed.

Notes (author, year, journal in file header) on readings.  Top of each note document has authors, year, jounral, title, and keywords as subsections that can be used to later index through files if needed.

.bib file updated with each new .md note file for use in compiling references in LaTeX.

### Read Papers
* [Buckley2016EBF - Variation in the diet of Arctic Cod (Boreogadus saida) in the Pacific Arctic and Bering Sea](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/pacificArctic/Buckley2016EBF.md) 
     * They look at the summer diet of arctic cod across multiple age classes from opportunistic samples throughout the Chukchi and Bering Sea.  Along a north-south gradient in the ECS, copepods dominate diets at higher latitudes, euphausiids at lower latitudes.  Larger fish have a more diverse diet of larger prey (decapods, fishes).  Arctic cod are highly opportunistic. 
* [Kitamura2017CSR - Seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in the southern Chukchi Sea revealed from acoustic backscattering strength](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/pacificArctic/Kitamura2017CSR.md) 
     * Use of AZFPs to describe the seasonality of zooplankton biomass, and identify the dominant scatterers in the southern Chukchi Sea, finding a seasonal peak in biomass in autumn and a minimum in early spring, not corresponnding with phytoplankton production.  Zooplpankton communities in the southern Chukchi are largely driven by advection from the Bering. 
* [Laurel2016PB - Temperature-dependent growth and behavior of juvenile Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and co-occurring North Pacific gadids](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/pacificArctic/Laurel2016PB.md) 
     * Laboratory temperature experiments were conducted on gadidae to investigate the importance of temperature on fish growath and survival.  Arctic fishes can grow faster at cooler temperatures, but have a limited range.  Their ability to grow under future climate scenarios is presented. 
* [Loggerwell2015PO - Fish communities across a spectrum of habitats in the western Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/pacificArctic/Loggerwell2015PO.md) 
     * Synthesized five years of surveys to look at differences in abundance (density) of animals from the lagoon to shelf slope in the Chukchi and Beaufort.  They also looked at icthyoplankton.  Based on Icthyoplankton, they state that the Beaufort Sea shelf is likely a spawning location for Arctic cod. 
* [Quast1974FB - Density distribution of juvenile Arctic cod, Boregogadus saida in the Eastern Chukchi Sea in the fall of 1970](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/pacificArctic/Quast1974FB.md) 
     * This was the first fisheries survey of Arctic cod in the NE Chukchi (as far as I know), and showed that there were primarily young of the year A. cod, with a depth-dependent density.  Quast also speculates about the origin of the juvenile cod. 
* [Vestfals2018 - Distribution of early life stages of Arctic cod and saffron cod in the Pacific Arctic](https://github.com/leviner/ReadingList/tree/master/pacificArctic/Vestfals2018.md) 
     * Vestfals et al aim to narrow down the potential spawning grounds for arctic and saffron cod based on the physical oceanography and summer distribution.  It contains a good review in the intro of the current literature on early life history.
