## Significance:
Arrhenius et al. deployed an upward facing echosounder in two lakes to determine the ability of a split-beam echosounder to track fish, using a stereo-video system to validate the recorded swim speeds.

## Notes:
Swim speed is important for foraging and bioenergetics models where size, swim speed interactions, and energy gains/losses are important.  Camera observations are limited by visibility, where acoustics are not.

Data are from a 70kHz EY500 in 3 lakes in NY, mounted on a rack and facing upwards at the surface.  An enclosure was set up in the lake for containing fish for simultaneous stereocamera observations.

Gillnets were used to identify the fish in the lake.

Fish tracks were determined using the Simrad EP500 package, with minimum continuous echoes of 4-pings and a max 10cm change per ping as well as:
- trace did not "divide" into two traces
- there were no jumps throughout the beam (back and forth between two possible targets)
- TS varied by no more than +-1dB

Because of the single target requirement to identify a track, most of the tracks were from dusk or dawn, not from daytime when schooling behavior was greater.

Used a sphere at 5Hz to look at the possible horizontal and vertical error of the swim speed predictions (i.e., sphere tracing experiment).  Average detectable velocity of the sphere was 2.61 cm/s, with decreasing accuracy as you move away from the center of the beam. This was supposed to be a stationary target...and the authors attribute this to the variability in phase differentials which means a bias towards faster swimming speeds.

Concluding hypotheses
* Split beam acoustics swim speeds matched well with stereo-video system, with acoustics more equipped for smaller fishes
* Phase error could be substantial for smaller fishes
* Moored acoustics are best suited for areas where there are "one or few year classes, and when the size distribution can be confirmed by fishing"
