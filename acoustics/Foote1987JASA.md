## Significance:
An investigation into the backscattering cross section, or target strength, of fish, and the methods for in situ determination of TS and relating it to fish length.  Foote proposes a set of regression analyses from in situ measurements for generalized fish families based on available data.

## Notes:
Three systems for collecting in situ measurements:
- Dual-beam systems where simultaneous observation by concentric circles allows for beam compensation off-axis and determination of target strength
- Split-beam systems where the division of the transducer face into quadrants for separate processing of signal return allows for beam compensation of signal
- Single-beam systems where many observations of a single target are required to determine a target strength value

TS = 10log&sigma;/4&pi;; where &sigma; is the mean backscattering cross section of the fish.

TS can also be found using a regression of the length of the fish as derived in [Love, 1977](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.381672), who found that &sigma; and *l*<sup>2</sup> were proportional.  We then use:

TS = 20log*l* + *b* ; where *l* is the mean fish length (cm) and *b* is a coefficient derived for a specific species/group/family.

The primary difference in fish groups is the swimbladder type:
- physostomes with a duct in/out of the swimbladder where air can be pushed out, but they do not have a rete mirabile for oxygen exchange through the blood to refill/regulate the bladder size efficiently.
- physoclists which have closed swim bladders and use this gas exchange via blood oxygen to manipulate buoyancy.

TS can further be distinguished by differences in family composition within these groups, and then again by species depending on number of measurements.

TS can vary with time of day as a result of orientation.

Are variations in TS a result of fluctuations in species, time of day, or behavior, and which is most important?  How do individual factors influence the variation?  Tilt angle is a major source of variance, and Foote presents the TS values determined by tethered observations.

Concluding hypotheses
* Foote presents a set of generalized equations for the relationship between target strength and mean fish length
* Most variability in the regressions is due to species and behavior which are hard to quantify without a) significant number of measurements and b) knowledge of the orientation of those fish being observed in situ
