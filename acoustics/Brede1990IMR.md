## Title:
Target tracking with a split-beam echo sounder
## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Demonstration of the ability to track targets and the ability to determine target strength and directivity in the beam.

## Notes:
Systems were calibrated then installed above or in fish pens.  Experiments were done using an ES400 system at 38 kHz.

For each ping, when a sample reaching a threshold was encountered, the angle data for it and the 6 next samples were considered a "target", and the 3 greatest min/max angle values were removed.  The final target was considered the first depth meeting the threshold, the maximum amplitude in that window. and the filtered angles.

Three vessels with hull mounted systems were also used and calibrated with a 60mm Cu sphere.

They found an angular resolution of .13 degrees (at 18m, accuracy of 4.1cm).  With good beam mapping, the resolution within the 3dB angle can be +-.1dB.

6 fish tracks were obtained from the pen data.  There is variability of target strength within the tracks, related to either the tail-beat movement or the transverse movement of the fish.



Concluding hypotheses
* Beam pattern must be confirmed in order to obtain accurate TS measuremets of a moving target.
* There is an obvious possibility of the ability to track fish speed and direction.
