## Significance:
One of the earlier papers presenting the use of target tracking of individual fish to evaluate individual behavior.  Used a 38 kHz EK500 for data collection.

## Notes:
Ship-based split-beam observations, tracks were "collected" from single pings where at most one ping was missing a detection.  Data was collected at both "dusk" and "night" to investigate behavior associated with DVM.

Filtered to -70dB, with a vertical resolution of 10cm and a horizontal angular resolution of .13 degrees, with error increasing with range.

Look for accuracy by comparing swim speed with angular position (i.e., is speed of the fish a 1-to-1 direct relationship with angle size?  likely greater angle bias).  They backed out ship rolling from a linear relationship with the target track (was movement of simultaneously tracked fish correlated?).

Individuals were only tracked outside of the "major scattering layer".  

Swim speeds at dusk were greater than at night, though not considered significant.

Used net-to-gross ratio of swim speeds to suggest that waves did not contribute to the vertical distribution.  However in the vertical dimension, erratic swimming (either positionally or very high values of BL/sec) was likely attributed to heave.

The behavior of tracked individuals was not consistent with the population behavior determined by the scattering layers.  Individuals appear to move down while the layer moves up, though it is possible that the fish are tilted so much as to reduce the TS, making it harder/less likely to detect them at that angle, but the aggregation still appears.

Concluding hypotheses
* Mesopelagic fish may be more active swimmers than previously assumed.
* Speed and pattern is related to feeding behavior.
* Target tracking is a great method for answering these behavioral questions in situ, with tracking data being improved by using moored, upward facing sounders, increasing ping rate, increasing temporal resolution, and maximizing SNR.
