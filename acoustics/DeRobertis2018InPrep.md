## Significance:
Currently in preparation manuscript on the 2016 Saildrone deployment in the Bering Sea, investigating vessel avoidance during opportunistic and follow-the-leader ship-saildrone comparisons.

## Notes:
Two saildrones were outfitted with WBATs in 2016.
- Two follow-the-leader events were done where the Oscar Dyson followed a saildrone for almost a day
- All insatnces where the saildrone and DY crossed paths within 20km and 7 days were also used for comparison

Keiser intercal was used for the vessel sA comparisons, and thus can be presented as a percent change

Bubble attenuation increases as a function of windspeed
- applications of bottom and transmit pulse filters appear to properly identify these low-biased pings

Saildrone 1 consistently observed more and shallow backscatter
- daytime: similar levels of backscatter, but shallower in the SD data
- nighttime: higher levels of backscatter in SD, likely due to more fish in shallow water

Saildrone 2 was a bit different, when fish were closer to the bottom, the SD actually detected less fish.  This is interpreted as beign driven by the larger ADZ of the wider beam on the 70-18CD transducer, so near bottom fishes are not detectable they are on the DY.

For fish (large pollock), backscatter from 30-70m depth was greater when detected by the saildrone, while backscatter >70m was greater for the DY (though this was not significant).  Overall, backscatter was consistently shallower throughout the large-scale comparison.

Saildrones produced good measurements overall, but there is clear degradation in high wind speeds with the generation 3 vehicle.  The echosounder compared well with the DY, though there are discrepencies that can be attributed to a combination of 1) fish avoidance 2) calibration uncertainty 3) EK60 over-amplification of low-power signal, and temporal variability in the intercalibration sampling.

One cannot overlook the necessity for species composition in acoustic interpretation and thus the importance of trawling/sampling for ecological interpretation.  While there is a possibility for identification through scatterer properties, current instrumentation is not sufficient to infer ecological significance from acoustics alone unless in a well classified environment.

"Future work should transition from proof-of concept studies to applied studies of marine organisms and evaluations of how the capabilities of this new technologies can be best be used to inform understanding of the abundance, distribution and behavior of marine organisms."
