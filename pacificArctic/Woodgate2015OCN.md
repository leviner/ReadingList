## Title:

## Keywords:
bering strait, adcp, sea ice, chukchi sea

## Geographic Coverage
Bering Strait, Chukchi Sea

## Field Dates:
09/01/1990 - 09/01/2014

## Significance:
Overview of the ADCP and other moored sensors deployed from 1990-2014 in the Bering Strait.  Stresses the importance of the Bering Strait as the sole conduit of water into the Arctic from the Pacific.  Near-complete 24 year time series of flow through Bering Strait.

## Notes:
Pacific waters are found throughout half the area of the upper ocean in the Arctic.
Drives ice melt/freeze
- Summer pacific water creates a source of heat below the sea ice in winter, and the winter pacific water forms a protective layer between the ice and the deep warm atlantic waters in the arctic.

Added the ISCAT moorings for upper water column measurements of salinity and temp.

With 'average' or neutral winds, flow through the strait is typically 30 cm s-1.  Flow intensification on the US side near the surface and coast.  Warm ACC waters, cool mid-strait waters, stron east> west gradient in salinity.

With strong northerlies, ACW moves away from the coast and "spill" into the strait, creating a strong two layer water column.  In some years though, this stratification is less apparent in salinity, and is therefore result of solar heating.

Surface cooling leads to unstable column and deep mixing in late-Fall.  

During the winter, almost all of the strait and the chukchi is near or at freezing temperature.

They also used adcp to look at ice thickness, and showed large variability in ice thickness at the strait, from <1 to >2 on average, and a max of >18m.

Pacific waters are 1/3 of freshwater entering the arctic, increasing with the increase in volume flux.  

Concluding hypotheses
* Waters close to the islands likley differ from the rest of the strait due to eddy entrapment
* There has been an increase in volume flux since 2001 to present day, from ~.7 Sv to <1, corresponding to an increase in heat flux and freshwater flux, with 1/3 associated with wind and 2/3 associated with the pressure difference
