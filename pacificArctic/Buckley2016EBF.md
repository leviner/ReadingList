## Significance:
They look at the summer diet of arctic cod across multiple age classes from opportunistic samples throughout the Chukchi and Bering Sea.  Along a north-south gradient in the ECS, copepods dominate diets at higher latitudes, euphausiids at lower latitudes.  Larger fish have a more diverse diet of larger prey (decapods, fishes).  Arctic cod are highly opportunistic.

## Notes:
Fish were taken from various surveys in ice-free season from a combination of surface and bottom trawl data (note, no midwater stomachs were used).  FIsh were identified and lengthed to fork length, weight was estimated from l-w regression.

Total range of lengths was from 3.4 to 26 cm

In the NECS, CCS, and NBS, juvenile/;arval a cod (<6.4cm) had their diet made up almost entirely of copepods.  

"...within the ECS, Arctic cod consumed higher proportions of copepods at higher latitudes, while at lower latitudes they consumed higher proportions of euphausiids"

Arctic cod are opportunistic feeders, with the dominant diet components being copepods, hyperiid amphipods, euphausiids, and larvaceans.  Younger/smaller fish consume copepods and euphausiids while larger/older fish consume a greater amount of fishes and benthic inverts.


Concluding hypotheses
* Consumption of copepods in negatively correlated to body size, while fish and shrimp are positively correlated
* Amphipod proportion in the diet may be more indicative of availability then preference
* High consumption of copepods in the NECS may be due to high availability of arctic species due to local production (i.e., copepods from the shelf break), or be indicative of a very large pulse from the NBS
* Arctic cod are highly opportunistic
