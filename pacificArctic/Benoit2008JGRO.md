## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:
12/12/2003 - 06/01/2004
## Significance:
This study describes the presence and dispersal of a large, dense aggregation of Arctic cod observed overwinter in Franklin Bay, and aims to explore the physical and behavioral mechanisms responsible for their retention in deep water.

## Notes:
Previous observations of A. cod standing biomass in the Canadian archipelago in summer showed biomass >25x less than needed to meet the consumption requirements of seabirds and mammals.

The large aggregations of cod are expected in fall and winter when fish gather prior to spawning events under sea ice.  

3 frequency EK60 (38, 120, and 200) were run, and 1 hour from every day was used for the analysis.  They determined a relationship between TS and biomass where TS(w) = TS(n) - 10log(W) where TS(n) is the mean TS of the fish, W is the mean weight of the fish, and TS(w) is in dB/kg.

The physical oceanography of the bay is relatively stable, with warm (0) and saline (34) water at depth (150-200m), corresponding to the base of the pacific thermocline.  The water column becomes stable in January, following ice cover.

A weak shallow scattering layer and strong deep layer were present, with Sv increasing dramatically in late January in the deep layer.

Arctic cod were ~98% of all fish caught during spring sampling, ranging in length from 11 to 25 cm.  Copepods were the dominant zooplankter throughout the study.

The highest fish concentrations corresponded to the highest temperatures (except in late spring when the entire water column began to be populated).  Peak biomass occurred in April.  Based on the strong Sv values, copepods and other zooplankton would have had to be present in abundances mutiple orders of magnitude greater than what was caught, making fish the apparent primary scatterer.
Primary uncertainty is in the TS estimate of Arctic cod.

The fish were associated with the deeper half (>140m) of the pacific halocline which originates in the Bering and Chukchi Seas.  Fish were likely transported into the bay, then a weakening of the flow supported their retention, since during spawning they likely are not using extensive energy for retention.  Fish sampling in late spring showed mostly empty stomachs, indicating fasting.  Deep DV<, no shallower than 100m, likely helped with retention.

The first shallow DVM into the cold layers coincided with the first detection of chlorophyll a in the surface waters, in mid-March.  At this point the aggregations likely break up as fish move shallow to feed and are swept out of the bay.

The depth keeping behavior is likely two-fold in winter: 1) keeping in the metabolic advantageous deep water and 2)staying below the dive depth of ring seals (~100m).



Concluding hypotheses
* Deep, warm water can serve as a winter refuge for Arctic cod
* Shallow DVM behavior and aggregation dispersal coincide with the presence of shallow primary productivity
* In deeper bays and basins of the Canadian archipelago, fish are retained due to preference for warmer deep Pacific halocline water
