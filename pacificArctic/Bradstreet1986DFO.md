## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage
Canadian Arctic
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Technical report on the importance of Arctic cod to the Canadian Arctic ecosystem, covers aspects of distribution, physiology, and ecological significance across North American waters.  Includes review of much of the work done prior to the 1980s, and a focus on ringed seal predation of A. cod.

## Notes:
Distribution
- Bering Sea: Occur in the northern Bering near St. Lawrence Island.  Southern limit of the distribution may be temperature dependent. Some studies have found them significantly more abundant in winter.
- Chukchi Sea: Little true "offshore" sampling has occured, but Arctic cod have been found near Kotzebue sound and Pt. Lay, including coastally. Y-O-Y were common in the north.
- Beaufort Sea: Found throughout the western beaufort, both offshore and nearshore.  Distribution however is poorly documented.  Ichthyoplankton studies in the canadian beaufort have found YOY fish.
- Central and Western Canadian Arctic: Fish reported under sea ice in resolute bay and found in diet studies of seabirds and marine mammals
- Canadian Eastern Arctic: Found in studies off the coast of Greenland and in Hudson Bay, and observed in small studies in coastal regions (bays/inlets).  YOY are common in Lancaster Sound and Baffin Bay.
- Labrador Sea and NW Atlantic: Minimal sampling has found both adults and YOY in the northern regions, inshore and offshore.

Studies measuring abundance of A. cod show that in the Pacific, A. cod reach the southern extent of their distribution near St. Lawrence Island, and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (immediately south of Newfoundland) in the Atlantic. YOY are most abundant in the eastern arctic in nearshore waters, mainly in upper 50m.  

Diet
- Diet of YOY A. cod: calanoid copepods, copepodites, and naupliar stages were the most abundant food item across regions. YOY typically feed on the abundant group that is available, not limited to particular group or species. Regardless of location and depth, prey was consistent.
- Diet of adult A. cod: Mostly copepods, amphipods, mysids, and smaller fish.  Copepods were consistently the most important component of their diet.  

Primary difference from juvenile is the size/stage of copepods consumed.  Primary shift in composition is from copepod to amphipod as they grow.

Aging
- Otolith aging is reliable, even for small fish
- Hyaline layers are laid down during periods of slow growth, which tends to be in winter.  In older fish, this peaks slightly later than in younger fish.  It's been confirmed to be a reliable annual mark.

Differences between regions:
- No significant differences in age-frequency distributions in predators.
- Inter-regional differences exist across the arctic in length at Age and between years
- " comparisons of total otoliths length at age provide strong evidence of interannual differences in growth within regions"

Sources of mortality:
- Marine seabirds
- Marine mammals (ringed seal, bearded seal, harp seal, narwhal, whales).  In late august/september, large feeding aggregations are observed in the canadian arctic feeding on A. cod.  These are usually multispecies aggregations in nearshore environments.  Arctic cod have been observed to form dense schools in response to such feeding events.  There does not appear to be a bias in length class in marine mammal feeding.
- Ice edge hunting (humans)
