## Significance:
Use of a moored 38kHz echosounder to correlate backscatter with oceanographic variability over an 18-month deployment in Monterey Bay, CA, USA.  Same system used in [Urmy et al, 2012, *J. Mar. Sci.*](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/69/2/184/701699).

## Notes:
*My interest in this paper is the methods (statistic and visual) used to explore moored echosounder time series data*

Used a bottom-mounted echosounder to monitor the changes in backscatter over 18 months and compare it with wind, temperature and fluorescence, all of which serve as proxies for upwelling.

Used -90 dB as a threshold (looking for krill).

Determined the pairwise relationship between each environmental variable (Upwelling, SST, SSH, fluorescence) and Sa/Center of Mass.  Plotted as grid showing daily values and pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, with an overlay of the seasonal cycle as a running average "loop", color coded for month to show seasonal cycles.

Ran cross correlations between acoustic and environmental series (Sa and CM)and found SST and SSH (upwelling) were significant.

Propose onshore ekman transport or advection of a pre-existing aggregation to explain the correlation between backscatter (biomass) and sea surface height.

Concluding hypotheses
* Complex relationship between the variability in biomass and the variability in the environment.
* Sub-seasonal correlations between biomass and the environment exist though are weaker than the seasonal cycle, which had a strong negative correlation to upwelling.
