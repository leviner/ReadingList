## Title:
Mesozooplankton abundance and distribution in association with hydrography on Hanna Shoal, NE Chukchi Sea, during August 2012 and 2013
## Keywords:
zooplankton, composition, distribution, copepod
## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
08/11/2012 - 08/14/2013
## Significance:
Description of the late-summer zooplankton community composition at Hannah Shoal during August of 2012 and 2013, focusing on copepods and euphausiids of interest for bowhead whales.

## Notes:
Hannah Shoal is seasonally ice-covered, lays between the central channel with bering seas summer water and the eastern pathway of the Alaskan coastal current to the east.

Most of the plankton community originates in the Bering, though zooplankton biomass at Hannah Shoal is lower than the shelfbreak and much of the primary production falls to the seafloor.

Community has previously been observed to be dominated by C. glacialis and C. hyperboreaus, and Pacific'Bering species of Neocalanus and C. marshallae might be present as well.  Calanus and Neocalanus are lipid rich and are of particular interest for the higher trophic levels, and serve as indicies of water masses (Glacialis from north and south, Neocalanus from Bering, hyberboreaos from north).  Possible episodic transport of high abundances of different species groups throughout the season.

Zooplankton were collected with bongo nets.  Pseudocalanus species were not differentiated, and marshallae/glacialis were grouped.



Concluding hypotheses
* Fish are friends, not food
* Don't swim towards the butt
* Dentists are bad at keeping pets
