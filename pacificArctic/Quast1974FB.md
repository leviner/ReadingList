## Title:
Density distribution of juvenile Arctic cod, Boregogadus saida in the Eastern Chukchi Sea in the fall of 1970
## Keywords:
arctic cod, depth dependence, trawl, chukchi, abundance

## Geographic Coverage
Chukchi Sea

## Field Dates:
09/27/1970 - 10/17/1970

## Significance:
This was the first fisheries survey of Arctic cod in the NE Chukchi (as far as I know), and showed that there were primarily young of the year A. cod, with a depth-dependent density.  Quast also speculates about the origin of the juvenile cod.

## Notes:
Jay Quast was a fisheries biologist at ABL and used an IKMT to trawl for A. cod from late september to mid october between about Cape Lisburne and Icy Cape

Tried to do all of the sampling at night.

Modal size of the specimen caught was 44mm

Caught between 10 and 1000 animals at each haul site, and saw an obvious increase in abundance with depth that "indicated a graded rather than a threshold response."

Concluding hypotheses
* A negative phototaxis in either the juveniles or their food could lead to the vertical distribution.  Quast also theiorizes that this response evolved based on reaction to predation from birds.
* Sources of juveile cod could be: Bering Sea, East Siberian Sea, or Chukchi.
* Cod probably spawned in Jan/Feb, based on physical oceanography had to either originate far away or been cycled in the Chukchi for a long time.
