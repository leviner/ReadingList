## Title:
Spatial heterogeneity in zooplankton summer distribution in the eastern Chukchi Sea in 2012â€“2013 as a result of large-scale interactions of water masses
## Keywords:
zooplankton, thermal regime, advection, arctic
## Geographic Coverage
Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
08/07/2012 - 09/25/2013
## Significance:
Describe the differences in zooplankton distribution (focussed on Calanus species of copepods) between 2012 and 2013 as part of the Arctic EIS study.  Zooplankton distribution is wind-driven and a balance between melt water and northward advection of warm Pacific water.

## Notes:
Evidence of multi-year warm/cold shifts in the Pacific Arctic:
- "warm state": increase of Pacific water along the coast (increase ACC flow)
- "cold state": water is deflected to the west funneled through Herald Canyon

4 Primary water masses:
- ACW: warm and fresh
- Anadyr/Bering Summer Water > Chukchi Summer Water: moderate temperatures and salinities
- Melt Water: cold and fresh
- Bering/Chukchi Winter Waters: cold and salty (near-bottom water)

Zooplankton species show specific affinities for particular water masses, with identifiable groups originating in the Pacific vs. Arctic.  

81 unique taxa were found, 51 of which were shelf-wide species.  Cannonical analysis revealed significant relationship between biomass of the major taxa and the physical environment.  Pacific species had a strong relationship with salinities.  Interannual differences in zooplankton biomass was primarily driven by C. glacialis abundance, with strong changes in the BCSW/WW conditions.

Lowest biomass in both years was in the ACW.  In the northern Chukchi, there was a high abundance of younger copepodites during the survey, decreasing the overall biomass of the C. glacialis population.  Copepodites increased in age (C4 to C5) moving north through the Chukchi, until ~71N when it switched to C4/C3, indicating a second source population.

In 2013, the pacific group of zooplankton was limited to ~70N while arctic species dominated the northern portion of the shelf in the meltwater.  Glacialis showed a mirroring effect of older and younger populations, likely from two distinct populations (Arctic and Pacific).

Shift in distribution looks to result from the change in advection and increase of meltwater in the north/northeast chukchi that shut down flow of the ACC.  Wind driven circulation can facilitate the southern movement of Arctic species relatively frequently.

Though deep water movement through Barrow canyon can lead to Arctic species entering the Chukchi shelf, analysis shows association with the melt water above the pycnocline.

2012 was "normal" and 2013 was "cold" for the eastern Chukchi shelf.  There is suggestion that during warm states, there is intensified flow of BCSW through the central channel, which would result in an elevated level of pacific-origin zooplankton biomass.  In contrast, increased meltwater would result in a retention of the pacific zooplankton in the southern (and possibly deflection to the western) Chukchi.  

We would expect the greatest differentiation of the zooplankton population to be north of 70 where there would be the most interaction in mid/late-summer of meltwater and pacific-origin waters.

C. hyperboreus in the C4 stage is 5 times larger than glacialis, so you would expect Arctic cod to take advantage of the likely presence of increased arctic species in the northeast chukchi shelf.

Unpublished work by the author showed in 2013 there was a dietary preference by juvenile A. cod for hyperboreus, even though the abundance of glacialis  was much higher.

Concluding hypotheses
* Observations support the cold/warm regime changes in zooplankton distribution across the Chukchi shelf
* Zooplankton distribution is moderated by wind-driven advection
* Pacific and arctic species distribution is based on the intensity of flow of BCSW along the central channel vs melt water across the northern shelf
