## Keywords:

## Significance:
This study aimed to describe the trophic structure and function of the Chukchi Sea foodweb using an ecopath model, representing just one of many possible mass-balance solutions.  Fish estimates were taken from beam trawl samples of the Eastern Chukchi shelf.

## Notes:
Commercial fisheries in AK are currently prohibited due to the lack of research needed to evaluate the impact of fishing on the ecosystem.

They are attempting to describe the trophic structure and material flow of the eastern Chukchi using an EcoPath model framework.

Bering Sea water and Alaska Coastal water influence the spatial variability in primary production,  higher production in the BSW, especially in the southern Chukchi where in open water season there is a continuous supply of BSW nutrients.  There is tight benthic-pelagic coupling, with links between the benthic biomass and the pelagic production.

Using food web metrics, they compare the chukchi ecosystem with other high latitude ecosystems in EcoPath models.

Fish biomass of the Chukchi came from a 1990 bottom trawl survey using CPUE.

Groups were evaluated using *EE*, where a value > 1 indicates that loss is greater than production.  For complete balance, all functional groups would need *EE*<=1. All fish had a *EE*>1, and they attribute this to an underestimate of biomass from the trawl (which makes sense due to the use of exclusively 1-year bottom trawl data).

A. cod, S. cod, and forage fish were the dominant prey items for seabirds and piscivorous mammals, with A. cod representing 22% of all seabird consumption and 41% of all piscivorous mammals.

Major trophic flows are centered on the benthos, with gadids being the dominant component of the fish community.  The eastern Chukchi has low productivity and is therefore vulnerable to fishing and other extractive activities.

This study had limited to no inclusion of pelagic components (meso pelagic fish and zooplankton), and they note that they were not very abundant in the demersal trawls.

Concluding hypotheses
* The tight trophic connection between A. cod and higher trophic levels shows their importance in the transfer from low levels to top predators and must be considered in future fishery discussions
* The benthos is the center of all trophic biomass distributions
