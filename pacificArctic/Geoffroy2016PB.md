## Title:
Vertical segregation of age-0 and age-1+ polar cod (Boreogadus saida) over the annual cycle in the Canadian Beaufort Sea
## Keywords:
vertical distribution, ontogenic migration, arctic cod, beafort sea
## Geographic Coverage
Canadian Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
10/01/2006 - 10/01/2012
## Significance:
The authors observed two distinct layers of arctic cod, an epipelagic layer of age-0 fish which forms in spring, begins DVM in summer, and settles to depth in late fall, and a mesopelagic layer of age-1+ fish.  They used TS to estimate length at depth to show a stratification and seasonal vaibility in the two layers, as well as estimate biomass.

## Notes:
Early acoustic surveys showed fairly dispersed distribution of arctic cod, particularly in deeper areas, but the estimates from these surveys in the canadian archipeligo were found to be ~32x too low to satisfy the energetics requirements of the predators (seabirds, marine mammals), so other aggregations must occur.  These aggregations were found in the Beaufort sea, where over the continental slope large agregations of age 1+ are found year round.

Testing the hypothesis that age-0 and age-1+ arctic cod are segregated until the fall when the age-0 fish migrate from the surface to depth, using acoustic records from 2006 to 2012 from various surveys.

Used 38 and 120 kHz EK60 data, and mostly used icthyoplankton (bongo-like) nets for fish sampling in fall, except in 201 when they also used midwater and demersal trawls.
Top 13.5 meters of the water column were excluded (draft).  -43 dB was used as the threshold for a 35-cm polar cod.  Compared the fish tracking with Sawada.

Biomass estimation: .25nm by 3m bins, using dB differencing between the 38 and 120 to distinguish fish from zoops, following Geoffroy et al., 2011 and Benoit et al., 2014.

The Amundsen overwinterd in 2007-2008 and was used to create a year-long time series, showing two distinct scattering layers, with a strong epipelagic layer forming in May, fully formed in August at which point you could see DVM occurring, increasing in depth between august and October until it was mixing with the mesopelagic layer, which persisted year round.

The Sawada index found 2 orders of magnitude more single targets, and about a 1dB stronger TS.  They used TS to estimate SL for the fish to determine size at depth.

A. cod dominate the pelagic fish in the Beaufort Sea, and this study confirmed that age-0 A. cod make up the majority of fishes in the epipelagic as well.  

TS measurements were only available from the periphery of aggregations and may not represent the aggregations themselves.  Because of Signal-to-Noise, the elimination of smaller targets with depth could be the reason for the increase in target and therefore fish size at depth.  However, they beleive that since less than 5% of the fish captured in the midwater deployments were <2.5cm and that the catches showed increasing size with depth, the TS estimations are likely non-biased.

A. cod <.9cm are more likely to have underinflated or underdeveloped swimbladders, which occurs between .6 and .8cm growth, and therefore are likely to be undetected (or falsely ID'd as zooplankton), so there the epipelagic biomass is likely underestimated.

Variations in monthly estimates may be due to movement off of the seafloor in spring/summer, including the possibility that many fish leave the seafloor with the ascention of diapausing calanus in spring.

DVM of age-0 fish started to occur in July, with TS measurements corresponding to fish of ~3cm in size (post-metamorphosis).  The biomass of this layer peaked in September, and later in the season fish begin to remain at depth as ther awareness of surface predators increases along with the decrease in copepod prey.  Decreasing TS in the upper water column may be due to the removal (now deep) of larger fish, leaving behind the smaller ones who have yet to migrate.

Concluding hypotheses
* A. cod make up ~95% of all scattering in the Canadian Beaufort
* As prey abundance declines and the vulnerability to visual predators increases, age-0 fish shift from DVM to ontogenetic migration to deeper water.
* "climate-induced modification of the ice and temperature regimes in the surface layer will impact first and most directly the epipelagic larval and juvenile stages of polar cod, their planktonic food, and their predators."
